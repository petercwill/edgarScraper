This is my submission for the take home assignment.  Thank you for the opportunity!  I found it challenging, yet enjoyable.

to test installation try 'python -m unittest' all tests should run successfully.

to play around with the scraper please see the 'usage examples and implementation notes' in the notebooks directory.

My responses to the specifik questions asked in the writeup are contained in seperate notebooks in the notebook directory.  If there's any trouble executing the code cells, pdfs of these are contained in the docs directory - although the formatting is a little wonky.
