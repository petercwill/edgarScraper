revolving credit facility and completed a public offering of $518 convertible
senior notes maturing on February 15, 2012 for net proceeds of $504.
The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.0% per annum. As
a result of adopting FSP APB 14-1, the effective interest rate increased to
8.5%. The notes are convertible, at the holders option, equivalent
to a conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock. The portion of
the proceeds ($74) related to the conversion feature has been recognized as
additional paid-in capital. The Company retrospectively applied FSP APB 14-1
to the 2014 and 2017 convertible senior notes. During the first
quarter of 2009, PTNNT shareholders loaned an additional $124 to PTNNT. Total
principal outstanding under the shareholder loans was $165 and $41 as of March 31,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At March 31, 2009
and December 31, 2008, 43.75% or approximately $72 and $18, respectively,
were due to Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation, an affiliate of Sumitomo Mining
Corporation, an unrelated third party, and was non-recourse to Newmont, with
the remainder payable to Newmont. As discussed in Note 27, the Company
has agreed to provide a joint and several guarantee for the payment of principle
and interest amounts associated with the PTNNT project financing facility,
which was non-recourse to Newmont at March 31, 2009. Scheduled
minimum debt repayments at March 31, 2009 are $192 for the remainder
of 2009, $157 in 2010, $332 in 2011, $591 in 2012, $116 in 2013 and $1,584
thereafter. "

Represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at
March 31, 2009 for all borrowings outstanding pursuant to each
debt instrument including the applicable margin. The interest rates
presented do not include the impact of our interest rate derivative
agreements, deferred financing costs or commitment fees, all of
which affect our overall cost of borrowing. For information
concerning our derivative instruments, see note 5. (b)
Unused borrowing capacity represents the maximum availability
under the applicable facility at March 31, 2009 without regard
to covenant compliance calculations. At March 31, 2009, the
full amount of unused borrowing capacity was available to be
borrowed under each of the respective facilities. However, based on
the March 31, 2009 preliminary covenant compliance
calculations, we anticipate that our availability under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility will be limited to
€217.2 million ($287.3 million) when the March 31,
2009 bank reporting requirements have been completed. To the extent
we were to draw on the VTR Bank Facility (as defined below)
commitments, we would be required to set aside an equivalent amount
of cash collateral. (c)
Subsequent to March 31, 2009, UPC Holding
(i) completed an exchange offer with respect to a portion of
the borrowings outstanding under the UPC Holding Senior Notes due
2014 and (ii) issued new Senior Notes due 2018. For additional
information, see note 15. (d)
The UGC Convertible Notes are measured at fair value. Our
assessment of the fair value of the UGC Convertible Notes included
an estimated credit risk component of $96.3 million at
March 31, 2009. This credit risk component is estimated as the
difference between (i) the fair value of the UGC Convertible
Notes and (ii) the value of the UGC Convertible Notes derived
by holding all other inputs constant and replacing the market
credit spread with a credit spread of nil. The estimated change in
UGC’s credit risk during the first three months of 2009
resulted in a loss of $8.6 million that is included in realized and
unrealized gains (losses) due to changes in fair values of certain
investments and debt, net, in our condensed consolidated statement
of operations. For information regarding our fair value
measurements, see note 6. (e)
Pursuant to the deposit arrangements with the lender in
relation to VTR’s amended and restated senior secured credit
facility (the VTR Bank Facility), we are required to fund a cash
collateral account in an amount equal to the outstanding principal
and interest under the VTR Bank Facility. This cash collateral
account had a balance of $465.5 million at March 31, 2009, of
which $4.7 million is reflected as a current asset and $460.8
million is presented as a long-term asset in our condensed
consolidated balance sheet. UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility The UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility, as amended, is the senior secured credit facility of
UPC Broadband Holding. In March 2009, two additional facility
accession agreements (Facilities Q and R) were entered into under
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. Facility Q is a redrawable
term loan facility with an initial principal amount of
€267.0 million ($353.2 million). Facility R is a
non-redrawable term loan facility with an initial principal amount
of €236.0 million ($312.2 million). Both Facility Q and
Facility R closed on March 25, 2009 (the Closing Date). On the
Closing Date, certain of the lenders under the
€830.0 million ($1,098.0 million) Facility L, which was
fully drawn at the Closing Date, novated, in whole or in part,
their drawn commitments (in the aggregate amount of
€503.0 million ($665.4 million)) to Liberty Global
Europe BV, a direct subsidiary of UPC Broadband Holding, and
entered into either the new Facility Q or new Facility R.
Therefore, total third-party commitments under Facility L on the
Closing Date totaled €327.0 million ($432.6 million).
Subsequent to March 31, 2009, we increased the sizes of
Facilities Q and R and third-party commitments under Facility L
were further reduced. For additional information, see note
15. The details of our borrowings
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility as of March 31,
2009 are summarized in the following table: Final maturity date March 31, 2009 Facility Interest

The total committed amounts of Facilities I and L are
€250.0 million and €830.0 million,
respectively, however, €202.0 million and
€503.0 million, respectively, had been novated to
Liberty Global Europe BV at March 31, 2009. Therefore, total
third-party commitments at March 31, 2009 under Facilities I
and L were €48.0 million and €327.0 million,
respectively. (b)
The final maturity date for Facilities M and N is the earlier
of (i) December 31, 2014 and (ii) October 17,
2013, the date falling 90 days prior to the date on which the UPC
Holding Senior Notes due 2014 fall due, if such Senior Notes have
not been repaid, refinanced or redeemed prior to such date.
Subsequent to March 31, 2009, we agreed in principle to
refinance portions of Facilities M and N. For additional
information, see note 15. (c)
The applicable interest payable under Facility O is
2.75% per annum plus the specified percentage rate per annum
determined by the Polish Association of Banking Dealers —
Forex Poland or the National Bank of Hungary, as appropriate for
the relevant period. The principal amount of Facility O is
comprised of (i) a HUF 5,962.5 million ($25.6 million)
sub-tranche and (ii) a PLN 115.1 million ($32.7 million)
sub-tranche. (d)
The final maturity dates for Facilities Q and R are the earlier
of (i) July 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, and (ii) October 17, 2013, the date falling
90 days prior to the date on which the UPC Holding Senior Notes due
2014 fall due, if such Senior Notes have not been repaid,
refinanced or redeemed prior to such date. UGC Convertible
Notes In March 2009, we repurchased
€101.0 million ($136.9 million at the transaction dates)
principal amount of the UGC Convertible Notes at a purchase price
equal to 65% of face value, for a total of €66.4 million
($90.1 million at the transaction dates), including accrued
interest thereon. The change in the fair value of the repurchased
UGC Convertible Notes from December 31, 2008 through the
repurchase dates is included in realized and unrealized gains
(losses) due to changes in fair values of certain investments and
debt, net, in our condensed consolidated statement of operations
for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Other J:COM
debt In March 2009, J:COM entered
into (i) a ¥15.0 billion ($151.0 million) variable-rate
term loan agreement, of which ¥5.0 billion is due in March
2012 and ¥10.0 billion is due in March 2015, (ii) a
¥10.0 billion ($100.7 million) variable-interest rate term
loan agreement due in March 2014, (iii) a ¥4.0 billion
($40.3 million) variable-interest rate term loan agreement due in
March 2014 and (iv) a ¥1.0 billion ($10.1 million)
fixed-interest rate term loan agreement due in March 2016. All
amounts under these agreements were fully drawn in March 2009 and
proceeds were used to repay borrowings outstanding on certain other
J:COM revolving credit facilities. The interest rate on the
new variable-interest rate loans are based on three-month TIBOR
plus a margin ranging from 0.43% to 0.65%. The new ¥1.0
billion fixed-interest loan bears interest at 1.85%. These new
loan agreements contain covenants similar to those of J:COM’s
other credit facilities. Maturities of Debt and

of this table, we have assumed that (i) the
€800.0 million ($1,058.3 million) principal amount of
the UPC Holding Senior Notes due 2014 will be repaid, refinanced or
redeemed prior to October 17, 2013, (ii) Facilities M and

December 31, 2014, (iii) Facility Q of the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility will be repaid on July 31, 2014 and
(iv) Facility R of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
will be repaid on December 31, 2015. Subsequent to
March 31, 2009, (i) we refinanced a portion of the
borrowings outstanding under the UPC Holding Senior Notes due 2014
and (ii) we refinanced a portion of Facility L and agreed in
principle to refinance portions of Facilities M and N of the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility. For additional information, see
note 15. (b)
Amounts represent borrowings under the VTR Credit Facility, for
which the source of repayment is expected to be the related cash
collateral account. (c)
The remainder of 2009 amount includes $89.3 million of
borrowings under the News Corp. Forward, which we expect to settle
by surrendering the underlying shares of News Corp. Class A
common stock held by our company. The 2011 amount includes the
€399.0 million ($527.8 million) principal amount
outstanding under the UGC Convertible Notes. Although the final
maturity date of the UGC Convertible Notes is April 15, 2024,
holders have the right to tender all or part of their UGC
Convertible Notes for purchase by UGC on April 15,
2011, April 15, 2014 and April 15, 2019, for a
purchase price in euros equal to 100% of the principal

0,2009-05-05,901491,XBRL," 4. Debt Our debt
is comprised of the following (in thousands): March 29, December 28, 2009 2008 Revolving line of credit $ 103,000 $ 123,500 Debt associated with VIEs * 8,450 7,075 Other 75 79 Total debt 111,525 130,654 Less: current portion of debt (8,450 ) (7,075 ) Long-term debt $ 103,075 $ 123,579 *Papa Johns is the guarantor of BIBPs
outstanding debt. In January 2006, we executed a five-year,
unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Credit Facility) totaling $175.0 million.
Under the Credit Facility, outstanding balances accrue interest at 50.0 to 100.0
basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other
bank-developed rates, at our option. The commitment fee on the unused
balance ranges from 12.5 to 20.0 basis points. The increment over LIBOR and the
commitment fee are determined quarterly based upon the ratio of total
indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA), as defined. The remaining availability under our line of credit,
reduced for certain outstanding letters of credit, approximated $51.6 million
and $31.1 million as of March 29, 2009 and December 28, 2008,
respectively. The fair value of our outstanding debt approximates the carrying
value since our debt agreements are variable-rate instruments. The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative
and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring the maintenance
of specified fixed charges and leverage ratios. At March 29, 2009 and
December 28, 2008, we were in compliance with these covenants. We
presently have two interest rate swap agreements (swaps) that provide fixed
interest rates, as compared to LIBOR, as follows: FloatingRate Debt FixedRates The first interest rate swap agreement: January 16, 2007 to January 15, 2009 $ 60 million 4.98 % January 15, 2009 to January 15, 2011 $ 50 million 4.98 % The second interest rate swap agreement: January 31, 2009 to January 31, 2011 $ 50 million 3.74 % Our swaps are derivative instruments that are
designated as cash flow hedges because the swaps provide a hedge against the
effects of rising interest rates on present and/or forecasted future borrowings.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the swaps is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the
same period or periods during which the swaps affect earnings. Gains or losses
on the swaps representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current
earnings. Amounts payable or receivable under the swaps are accounted for as
adjustments to interest expense. The
following tables provide information on the location and amounts of our swaps in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements (in thousands): Fair

weighted average interest rate for our Revolving lines of credit, including the
impact of the previously mentioned swap agreements, was 4.5% and 5.4% for the
three months ended March 29, 2009 and March 30, 2008, respectively.
Interest paid in the three months ended March 29, 2009 and March 30,
3008, including payments made or received under the swaps, was $1.4 million and
$1.8 million, respectively.

2,2009-05-11,13610,XBRL," Note 9. Debt The components of debt at March 31, 2009
and December 31, 2008 are as follows: March 31, December 31, 2009 2008 Convertible subordinated
debentures $ 7,579 $ 7,464 Borrowings under
revolving credit facility 79,363 79,500 Term loans 27,000  Capital lease obligations 2,013 2,230 $ 115,955 $ 89,194 In March 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to amend its $150.0 million
five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility)
and extend its maturity to May 31, 2011. The $150.0 million
Facility has been restructured as an asset-based loan consisting of a revolving
credit facility of $123.0 million (the Revolver)
and $27.0 million in Term Loans. The $123.0 million
Revolver has an interest rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
plus 4.00% in the case of Eurodollar loans or a base rate plus 3.00% in the
case of Base Rate loans. The Revolver is secured by substantially all assets
of the Company as well as by pledges of stock and guaranties of certain operating
subsidiaries. The Revolver includes a $15.0 million sub-facility which is available to the Companys
Canadian subsidiary. The Revolver also includes a $25.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit
and a $14.0 million sub-limit
for swing line loans. The Companys ability to borrow under the $123.0 million
Revolver is subject to periodic borrowing base determinations. The borrowing
base will consist primarily of certain eligible accounts receivable and inventories.
Borrowings under the Revolver will be based on predetermined advance rates
based on assets (generally up to 85% of billed receivables, 80% of eligible
unbilled receivables and 50% of certain inventories including work-in-process). As of March 31, 2009, the
Company had approximately $79.4 million outstanding under the Revolver,
which is classified as long-term debt since the Revolver expires in May 2011. The $27.0 million Term Loans are comprised
of a $20.0 million Term Loan and a $7.0 million Term Loan.
The Term Loans require quarterly amortization payments scheduled to commence
June 30, 2009. The $20.0 million Term Loan will amortize
in quarterly installments of $1.67 million through March 31,
2011 with a payment of $6.66 million due at maturity in May 2011.
The $7.0 million Term Loan will amortize in quarterly installments
of $1.17 million over 18 months. The Term Loans have an
interest rate based on LIBOR plus 4.25% in the case of Eurodollar loans or
a base rate plus 3.25% in the case of Base Rate loans. The Term Loans are
secured by substantially all assets of the Company as well as by pledges of
stock and guaranties of certain operating subsidiaries. As of March 31,
2009 approximately $11.3 million of the Term Loans are classified
as a current liability. The Facility requires
compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage covenant as well as customary
affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on the Company and
its subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends, incur debt and liens,
engage in mergers and acquisitions and sales of assets, among other things.
The Company was in compliance with all loan covenants as of March 31,
2009. During the three months ended March 31,
2009, the average interest rate on the Companys Facility approximated
2.08%. The Company incurred costs of approximately $5.3 million
(of which approximately $3.9 million were paid as of March 31,
2009) related to the amendment and extension of the Facility. These
costs primarily consist of bank fees and fees paid to attorneys and other
third-party professionals and are being amortized through May 2011. The Companys $8.3 million Convertible
Subordinated Debentures (the Notes) have been reduced
by debt discounts of $741 and $856 as of March 31, 2009 and December 31,
2008, respectively. The Notes are classified as long-term debt as of March 31,

FSP APB 14-1 is discussed

Statements. The Company is not subject to any financial covenants under the
Notes other than cross default provisions. The Company also

Note 8 – Debt
On March 9, 2009, we filed a public shelf
registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and
common stock. On March 13, 2009, we issued notes totaling
$1,850, which included $700 bearing an interest rate of 5%
due March 15,
2014, $650 bearing an interest rate of 6% due March 15, 2019
and $500 bearing an interest rate of 6.875% due March 15,
2039. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting
fees and issuance costs were $1,817. We may redeem each series of
notes at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, upon at
least 30 days notice, at a redemption price equal to the principal
amount of the notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium,
together with accrued interest on such notes to the redemption
date. The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally
in right of payment with all our existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness. "

1,2009-07-23,42542,XBRL," Note 11. Financing Arrangements The
Company has a $500 million committed global syndicated revolving
credit facility, which expires in May 2012. Interest rates under
this facility vary depending upon: • The amount borrowed; • The Company’s
public debt rating by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s
and Fitch; and • At the Company’s
option, rates tied to the agent bank’s prime rate or, for U.S. Dollar
and Great Britain Pounds Sterling borrowings, the London Interbank Offered
Rate and for Euro Dollar borrowings, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate. At June 30, 2009, there were no borrowings
and $52 million in letters of credit outstanding under the facility.
At December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings and $35.6 million
in letters of credit outstanding under the facility. The level of unused borrowing
capacity varies from time to time depending, in part, upon the Company’s
compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement,
including the consolidated net worth requirement and maximum leverage ratio.
The Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants. Under the
most restrictive of these covenants, $1,791.7 million of income retained
in the business and additional paid-in capital was free from such limitations
at June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2009, the Company had borrowing
capacity under this facility of $448 million, after reductions for
borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the facility. At June 30,
2009, the Company had letters of credit and bank guarantees of $82.8 million,
inclusive of $52 million in letters of credit outstanding under the
Company’s syndicated revolving credit facility, as discussed above. At
June 30, 2009, the Company also maintained $75 million of
uncommitted domestic money market facilities and $158.5 million of
uncommitted and committed foreign working capital facilities with various
banks to meet short-term borrowing requirements. At June 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, there were $40.4 million and $37.7 million,
respectively, in borrowings outstanding under these facilities. These credit
facilities are provided by a small number of commercial banks that also provide
the Company with committed credit through the syndicated revolving credit
facility described above and with various cash management, trust and other
services. In February 2009, the Company issued $300 million
principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2019, which were issued below
par. The discount will be amortized over the life of the senior notes. In
addition, the Company deferred approximately $2 million of transaction
costs which will be amortized over the life of the 6.125% senior notes. Long-term
Debt Repayments The Company used a portion of the proceeds from
the issuance of the $300 million senior notes to repay $120 million
for the 6.6% senior notes, which matured on May 15, 2009. Lease
Commitments The Company leases certain of its office and manufacturing
facilities as well as machinery and equipment, including corporate aircraft,
under various committed lease arrangements provided by financial institutions.
Future minimum lease payments under operating leases were $176.5 million
at June 30, 2009. One of these arrangements allows the Company, rather
than the lessor, to claim a deduction for tax depreciation on the asset and
allows the Company to lease a corporate aircraft with a total commitment amount
of $43.8 million. This lease is priced at a spread over LIBOR. Lease
payments under this arrangement are expected to commence in the first quarter
of 2011. At June 30, 2009, there were no future payments outstanding
under this arrangement. "

H. Debt – On March 24,
2009, Alcoa issued $575 of 5.25% convertible notes due 2014 (the
“convertible notes”). The issuance of the convertible
notes includes $75 related to the exercise of an over-allotment
option by the underwriters. The underwriting discount and
third-party expenses for the issuance of the convertible notes was
$13 and will be amortized to interest expense over the five-year
term of the convertible notes. The convertible notes were issued
under Alcoa’s shelf registration statement dated
March 10, 2008. Interest on the convertible
notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15th and
September 15th each year, commencing on September 15,
2009. If there is an event of default under the convertible notes,
the principal amount of the convertible notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, may be declared immediately due and payable. These
amounts automatically become due and payable if an event of default
relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or
reorganization occurs. Alcoa does not have the right
to redeem the convertible notes prior to the stated maturity date.
Holders of the convertible notes have the option to convert their
notes into shares of Alcoa’s common stock at any time prior
to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day (March
13, 2014) immediately preceding the stated maturity date (March 15,
2014). The initial conversion rate for the convertible notes is
155.4908 shares of Alcoa’s common stock per $1,000 (in whole
dollars) principal amount of notes (89,407,210 shares), equivalent
to a conversion price of approximately $6.43 per share, subject to
adjustment, as defined in the convertible notes. Other than
receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares, holders do not have
the option to receive cash instead of shares of common stock upon
conversion. Accrued and unpaid interest that exists upon conversion
of a note will be deemed paid by the delivery of shares of
Alcoa’s common stock and no cash payment or additional shares
will be given to holders. On the issuance date of the
convertible notes, the market price of Alcoa’s common stock
was above the stated conversion price of $6.43 creating a
beneficial conversion option to the holders, as the convertible
notes were “in-the-money.” The beneficial conversion
option is defined as a benefit provided to the holders in the form
of non-cash interest expense to the Company. As a result, Alcoa
recorded a $66 increase to additional capital and a corresponding
decrease in the carrying value of the convertible notes
representing the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion
option. The $66 decrease will be amortized to interest expense over
the five-year term of the convertible notes effectively accreting
the carrying value of the convertible notes to $575 by the stated
maturity date. If Alcoa undergoes a
fundamental change, as defined in the convertible notes, holders
may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their
notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but
excluding, the repurchase date. Such a repurchase will be made in
cash. The convertible notes are
general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment
to any of Alcoa’s future indebtedness that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the convertible notes and
equally in right of payment with all of Alcoa’s existing and
future unsecured indebtedness and liabilities that are not so
subordinated. The convertible notes effectively rank junior to any
secured indebtedness of Alcoa to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated
to all debt and other liabilities of Alcoa’s
subsidiaries. The net proceeds from the
convertible notes ($562) and the issuance of common stock (see Note
L) were used to prepay the $1,300 outstanding under Alcoa’s
364-day revolving credit facility (see below). The remaining net
proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. During the first quarter of
2009, Alcoa borrowed $1,300 under the $1,900 364-day senior
unsecured revolving credit facility to support its operations. The
$1,300 was repaid on March 24, 2009 with the net proceeds from
the issuance of the convertible notes (see above) and common stock
(see Note L). There were no amounts outstanding under the $1,900
364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility at June 30,
2009. Also during the first quarter
of 2009, Alcoa Alumínio (Alumínio) borrowed a total of
$255 in new loans with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.25%
and a weighted-average maturity of 276 days from six financial
institutions. In the second quarter of 2009, $55 was repaid and a
new $55 was borrowed. As of June 30, 2009, there were $255 in
outstanding borrowings with a weighted-average interest rate of
4.97% and a weighted-average maturity of 309 days from six
financial institutions. The purpose of these borrowings is to
support Alumínio’s export operations. Additionally during the first
quarter of 2009, Alumínio borrowed $105 (R$236) under the
existing BNDES (Brazil’s National Bank for Economic and
Social Development) loans related to the Juruti bauxite mine
development, São Luís refinery expansion, and Estreito
hydroelectric power project. Total borrowings under these BNDES
loans were $784 (R$1,528) as of June 30, 2009. In May 2009, Alumínio
entered into two new loan agreements (the “Loans”) with
BNDES related to the Juruti bauxite mine development and the
São Luís refinery expansion. The first loan provides for a
commitment of $321 (R$750), which is divided into six subloans, and
will be used to pay for certain expenditures of the Juruti bauxite
mine development. Interest on two of the subloans totaling $257
(R$600) is a USD rate of interest equal to the average cost
incurred by BNDES in raising capital outside of Brazil, currently
4.19%, plus a weighted-average margin of 1.69%. Interest on four of
the subloans totaling $64 (R$150) is a BRL rate of interest equal
to BNDES’ long-term interest rate, currently 6.25%, plus a
weighted-average margin of 1.59%. As of June 30, 2009,
Alumínio borrowed $120 (R$245) and $37 (R$73) and the
weighted-average interest rate was 5.88% and 7.84% for the subloans
totaling $257 (R$600) and the subloans totaling $64 (R$150),
respectively. The second loan provides for
a commitment of $86 (R$200), which is divided into four subloans,
and will be used to pay for certain expenditures of the São
Luís refinery expansion. Interest on two of the subloans
totaling $69 (R$160) is a USD rate of interest equal to the average
cost incurred by BNDES in raising capital outside of Brazil plus a
weighted-average margin of 1.70%. Interest on two of the subloans
totaling $17 (R$40) is a BRL rate of interest equal to BNDES’
long-term interest rate plus a weighted-average margin of 1.70%. As
of June 30, 2009, Alumínio borrowed $33 (R$65) and $10 (R$19)
and the weighted-average interest rate was 5.89% and 7.95% for the
subloans totaling $69 (R$160) and the subloans totaling $17 (R$40),
respectively. Principal and interest on the
Loans are payable monthly beginning in November 2010 and ending in
April 2016. Prior to the beginning payment date, interest is
payable quarterly on borrowed amounts. The Loans may be repaid
early without penalty with the approval of BNDES once the portions
of the growth projects related to these Loans are completed. Also,
the Loans include a financial covenant that states that Alcoa must
maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5 or lower. "

approximately $63 million principal amount of its 5.875% Notes due
2036 for a premium of $4 million. The total gain attributed to this
transaction amounted to $11 million, which also included the
termination of approximately $35 million notional amount of
fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps for proceeds of $5
million.
In June 2009, the Company executed several
fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to convert $200 million of
its 5.45% Notes due 2018 from fixed rate debt to variable rate
debt. In April 2009, the Company executed several fixed-to-floating
interest rate swaps to convert $597 million of its 5.25% Notes due
2013 from fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. In January 2009,
the Company terminated $1,061 million notional amount of
fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements for proceeds of
$187 million. The basis adjustment on the debt, which was equal to
the proceeds from this swap termination, is being recognized as a
reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the
underlying debt. For further discussion of the Company’s
interest rate swaps, refer to “—Note 20. Financial
Instruments.”
In February 2009, Mead Johnson &
Company as borrower and Mead Johnson as guarantor, both of which
are indirect, majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered
into a three year syndicated revolving credit facility agreement.
The facility is unsecured and repayable on maturity in February
2012, subject to annual extensions if sufficient lenders agree. The
maximum amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit
permitted at any one time is $410 million, which may be increased
up to $500 million, at the option of Mead Johnson and with the
consent of the lenders, subject to customary conditions contained
in the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this
revolving credit facility at June 30, 2009.
The Company obtained a $2.0 billion,
revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders maturing in
December 2011, which is extendable with the consent of the lenders.
This facility contains customary terms and conditions, including a
financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated debt to
consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter.
The Company has been in compliance with this covenant since the
inception of this new facility. There were no borrowings
outstanding under this revolving credit facility at June 30,
2009. "

Company’s debt financing, please refer to Note 8 of the
Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the description
of the 2019 Notes set forth below. The Company satisfies its short-term
liquidity needs primarily through cash on hand and issuances of
U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper. As of July 3, 2009, the
commercial paper outstanding under the Company’s U.S. dollar
commercial paper program had a weighted average interest rate of
0.24% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 24.5 days.
There was no outstanding Euro-denominated commercial paper as of
July 3, 2009. Credit support for the commercial paper program
is provided by an unsecured $1.45 billion multicurrency revolving
credit facility which expires on April 25, 2012 and an
unsecured $75 million multicurrency revolving credit facility that
expires on May 3, 2010.
The Company has a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an
indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred
stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units
for future issuance. In March 2009, the Company used the shelf
registration statement to complete an underwritten public offering
of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40% senior
unsecured notes due 2019. The notes were issued at 99.93% of their
principal amount. The net proceeds, after expenses and the
underwriters’ discount, were approximately $745 million. A
portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our
outstanding commercial paper with the balance of the net proceeds
invested in cash and equivalents and expected to be used for
general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, further
refinancing of debt, working capital, share repurchases and capital
expenditures. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to
their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the
principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the
present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and
interest plus 40 basis points. If the Company experiences a change
of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a
specified period following the change of control, the Company will
be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest.
The Company has classified the
borrowings under the commercial paper programs at July 3, 2009
as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed
Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as
supported by availability under the above mentioned credit
facilities, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year
from the balance sheet date. "

all borrowings under its $2,000 revolving credit facility and completed a
public offering of $518 convertible senior notes maturing on February 15,
2012 for net proceeds of $504. The notes will pay interest semi-annually at
a rate of 3.0% per annum and the effective interest rate is 8.5%. The notes
are convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a conversion
price of $46.25 per share of common stock. The portion of the proceeds related
to the conversion feature has been recognized as additional paid-in capital. The Company retrospectively applied FSP APB 14-1 to the
2014 and 2017 convertible senior notes (Note 2). During the first
quarter of 2009, PTNNT shareholders loaned an additional $124 to PTNNT. Total
principal outstanding under the shareholder loans was $165 and $41 as of June 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At June 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008, 43.75% or approximately $72 and $18, respectively, were due to Nusa
Tenggara Mining Corporation, an affiliate of Sumitomo Mining Corporation,
an unrelated third party, and was non-recourse to Newmont, with the remainder
payable to Newmont. As discussed in Note 27, the Company has agreed to provide a joint
and several guarantee for the payment of principal and interest amounts associated
with the PTNNT project financing facility, which was non-recourse to Newmont
at December 31, 2008. During the second quarter of 2009,
Newmont borrowed net proceeds of $100 under its $2,000 senior revolving credit

fair value(1) $
1,725,259 $ 1,621,793 (1) The book value of our bank debt
approximates fair value because of its floating rate structure. The fair value
of our senior subordinated debt is based on quoted end of period market prices. Bank Debt In
October 2006, we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank
facility, which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility,
which is secured by substantially all of our assets. The bank credit facility
provides for an initial commitment equal to the lesser of the facility amount
or the borrowing base. On June 30, 2009, the borrowing base was $1.5 billion
and our facility amount was $1.25 billion. The bank credit facility
provides for a borrowing base subject to redeterminations semi-annually each
April and October and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. Our current
bank group is comprised of twenty-six commercial banks each holding between
2.4% and 5.0% of the total facility. Of those twenty-six banks, thirteen are
domestic banks and thirteen are foreign banks or wholly owned subsidiaries
of foreign banks. The facility amount may be increased up to the borrowing
base amount with twenty days notice, subject to payment of a mutually acceptable
commitment fee to those banks agreeing to participate in the facility amount
increase. At June 30, 2009, the outstanding balance under the bank
credit facility was $403.0 million and there was $847.0 million
of borrowing capacity available under the facility amount. The loan matures
October 25, 2012. Borrowing under the bank credit facility can either
be the Alternate Base Rate (as defined) plus a spread ranging from 0.875%
to 1.625% or LIBOR borrowings at the adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined) plus
a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.5%. The applicable spread is dependent upon
borrowings relative to the borrowing base. We may elect, from time to time,
to convert all or any part of our LIBOR loans to base rate loans or to convert
all or any part of the base rate loans to LIBOR loans. The weighted average
interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.5% for the three months ended
June 30, 2009 compared to 4.8% for the three months ended June 30,
2008. The weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.6%
for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to 4.9% in the same
period of the prior year. A commitment fee is paid on the undrawn balance
based on an annual rate of between 0.375% and 0.50%. At June 30,
2009, the commitment fee was 0.375% and the interest rate margin was 1.75%
on our LIBOR loans. At July 20, 2009, the interest rate (including
applicable margin) was 2.3%. Senior Subordinated Notes In
May 2009, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount
of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019 (“8.0% Notes”).
The 8.0% Notes were issued at a discount, which is being amortized over the
life of the 8.0% Notes due 2019. Interest on the 8.0% Notes is payable semi-annually,
in May and November, and is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. We
may redeem the 8.0% Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15,
2014, at redemption prices of 104.0% of the principal amount as of May 15,
2014 and declining to 100.0% on May 15, 2017 and thereafter. Before May 15, 2012,
we may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
8.0% Notes at a redemption price equal to 108.0% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, with the proceeds of certain equity
offerings, provided that at least 65% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the 8.0% Notes remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence
of such redemption and also provided such redemption shall occur within 60 days
of the date of the closing of the equity offering. Debt Covenants Our
bank credit facility contains negative covenants that limit our ability, among
other things, to pay cash dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets,
enter into certain hedging contracts, change the nature of our business or
operations, merge, consolidate, or make investments. In addition, we are required
to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement)
of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0 and a current ratio (as defined in the credit
agreement) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with our covenants
under the bank credit facility at June 30, 2009. The
indentures governing our senior subordinated notes contain various restrictive
covenants that are substantially identical and may limit our ability to, among
other things, pay cash dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets,
enter into transactions with affiliates, or change the nature of our business.
At June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with these covenants. "

Debt Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper As of June 30, 2009, the Company had borrowing capacity of up to $1.2 billion under its long-term revolving bank credit facility, which expires in September 2012. Annual facility fees are currently 0.08 percent for the facility. The rate is subject to change based upon changes in BNSF’s senior unsecured debt ratings. Borrowing rates are based upon (i) LIBOR plus a spread determined by BNSF’s senior unsecured debt ratings; (ii) money market rates offered at the option of the lenders; or (iii) an alternate base rate. BNSF must maintain compliance with certain financial covenants under its revolving bank credit facility. At June 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. At June 30, 2009, there were no bank borrowings against the revolving credit agreement. BNSF issues commercial paper from time to time that is supported by the revolving bank credit facility. Outstanding commercial paper balances reduce the amount of borrowings available under this agreement. The classification of commercial paper is determined by the Company’s ability and intent to use long-term or short-term sources to settle the obligations. As of June 30, 2009, commercial paper balances were classified as long-term debt due within one year, as the Company is currently utilizing operating cash flows to settle the obligations. Previously, the Company classified outstanding commercial paper as long-term debt. The maturity value of commercial paper as of June 30, 2009, of $267 million, reduced the total capacity available under the revolving credit agreement to $933 million. Notes and Debentures In February 2009, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized an additional $1 billion of debt securities that may be issued through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) debt shelf registration process, for a total of $1.5 billion authorized to be issued as of June 30, 2009. Capital Leases During the first six months of 2009, BNSF entered into a 12-year capital lease to finance $368 million of locomotives and freight cars. Additionally, BNSF entered into capital leases totaling $65 million to finance maintenance of way and other vehicles/equipment with lease terms of five to seven years. Financing Obligation In 2005, the Company commenced the construction of an intermodal facility that it intended to sell to a third party and subsequently lease back. As of June 30, 2009, construction of the facility was substantially completed for a cost of approximately $160 million. All improvements have been sold to the third party and BNSF leased the facility from the third party for 20 years. This sale leaseback transaction was accounted for as a financing obligation due to continuing involvement. The outflows from the construction of the facility were classified as investing activities, and the inflows from the associated financing proceeds were classified as financing activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fair Value of Debt Instruments At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the fair value of BNSF’s debt, excluding capital leases and interest rate hedges, was $8,399 million and $8,323 million, respectively, while the book value was $8,213 million and $8,274 million, respectively. The fair value of BNSF’s debt is primarily based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or on the current rates that would be offered to BNSF for debt of the same remaining maturities. The book value of commercial paper approximates fair value due to its short maturity. Guarantees As of June 30, 2009, BNSF Railway has not been called upon to perform under the guarantees specifically disclosed in this footnote and does not anticipate a significant performance risk in the foreseeable future. Debt and other obligations of non-consolidated entities guaranteed by the Company as of June 30, 2009, were as follows (dollars in millions): Guarantees BNSF Principal Maximum Maximum Remaining Ownership Amount Future Recourse Term Capitalized Percentage Guaranteed Payments Amounta (in years) Obligations Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. 0.5

However, BNSF could receive reimbursement from certain insurance policies if the liability exceeds a certain amount. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BNSF Railway, has a guarantee in connection with its remaining special limited partnership interest in Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines Partners, L.P. (SFPP), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., to be paid only upon default by the partnership. All obligations with respect to the guarantee will cease upon termination of ownership rights, which would occur upon a put notice issued by BNSF or the exercise of the call rights by the general partners of SFPP. Kansas City Terminal Intermodal Transportation Corporation BNSF Railway and another major railroad jointly and severally guarantee $52 million of debt of Kansas City Terminal Intermodal Transportation Corporation, the proceeds of which were used to finance construction of a double track grade separation bridge in Kansas City, Missouri, which is operated and used by Kansas City Terminal Railway Company (KCTRC). BNSF Railway has a 25 percent ownership in KCTRC, accounts for its interest using the equity method of accounting and would be required to fund a portion of the remaining obligation upon default by the original debtor. Westside Intermodal Transportation Corporation and The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas BNSF Railway has outstanding guarantees of $49 million of debt, the proceeds of which were used to finance construction of a bridge that connects BNSF Railway’s Argentine Yard in Kansas City, Kansas, with the KCTRC mainline tracks in Kansas City, Missouri. The bridge is operated by KCTRC, and payments related to BNSF Railway’s guarantee of this obligation would only be called for upon default by the original debtor. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP In the third quarter of 2007, BNSF Railway entered into an indemnity agreement with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP (Chevron Phillips), granting certain rights of indemnity from BNSF Railway, in order to facilitate access to a new storage facility. Under certain circumstances, payment under this obligation may be required in the event Chevron Phillips were to incur certain liabilities or other incremental costs resulting from trackage access. Residual Value Guarantees (RVG) In the normal course of business, the Company enters into leases in which it guarantees the residual value of certain leased equipment. Some of these leases have renewal or purchase options, or both, that the Company may exercise at the end of the lease term. If the Company elects not to exercise these options, it may be required to pay the lessor an amount not exceeding the RVG. The amount of any payment is contingent upon the actual residual value of the leased equipment. Some of these leases also require the lessor to pay the Company any surplus if the actual residual value of the leased equipment is over the RVG. These guarantees will expire between 2009 and 2011. The maximum future payments, as disclosed in the Guarantees table above, represent the undiscounted maximum amount that the Company could be required to pay in the event the Company did not exercise its renewal option and the fair market value of the equipment had significantly declined. BNSF does not anticipate such a large reduction in the fair market value of the leased equipment. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had recorded a $68 million asset and corresponding liability for the fair value of RVG. All Other As of June 30, 2009, BNSF guaranteed $4 million of other debt and leases. BNSF holds a performance bond and has the option to sub-lease property to recover up to $1 million of the $4 million of guarantees. These guarantees expire between 2011 and 2013. Other than as discussed above, there is no collateral held by a third party that the Company could obtain and liquidate to recover any amounts paid under the above guarantees. Other than as discussed above, none of the guarantees are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. The Company does not expect performance under these guarantees to have a material effect on the Company in the foreseeable future. Indemnities In the ordinary course of business, BNSF enters into agreements with third parties that include indemnification clauses. In general, these clauses are customary for the types of agreements in which they are included. At times, these clauses may involve indemnification for the acts of the Company, its employees and agents, indemnification for another party’s acts, indemnification for future events, indemnification based upon a certain standard of performance, indemnification for liabilities arising out of the Company’s use of leased equipment or other property, or other types of indemnification. Due to the uncertainty of whether events which would trigger the indemnification obligations would ever occur, the Company does not believe that these indemnity agreements will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additionally, the Company believes that, due to lack of historical payment experience, the fair value of indemnities cannot be estimated with any amount of certainty and that the fair value of any such amount would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Agreements that contain unique circumstances, particularly agreements that contain guarantees that indemnify for another party’s acts are disclosed separately if appropriate. Unless separately disclosed above, no fair value liability related to indemnities has been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. "

As of June 30, 2009, there were no borrowings under either of these revolving credit agreements, which expire in October 2011 and November 2011, respectively. The undrawn portions under both of these agreements are also available to serve as backup facilities for the issuance of commercial paper. We generally use our commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of p
otential acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. We had $856 million of commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2009, all of which was scheduled to mature in less than one month. In February 2009, we redeemed the entire $500 million outstanding principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes Due 2009 that were due June 1, 2009 at a redemption price in U.S. dollars equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus interest accrued. On June 1, 2009, we repaid our $400 million of 61⁄2% Notes Due 2009 which matured on the same date. We have an existing universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement.

second quarter of 2009, ComEd repurchased $191 million of its
credit enhanced variable-rate tax-exempt debt. This debt was then
remarketed with credit enhancement provided by letters of credit
issued under ComEd’s unsecured revolving credit facility. The
letters of credit expire shortly before the expiration of the
credit facility in 2011.
Generation
has letters of credit that will expire in the third quarter of
2009, which are used to credit enhance variable-rate long-term
tax-exempt debt totaling $307 million, with maturities ranging from
2021 – 2034. Generation plans to remarket certain of these
bonds as unenhanced with different interest rate terms and
refinance the others as new unenhanced tax-exempt bonds. Generation
also has letter of credit facilities that will expire in the second
quarter of 2010, which are used to credit enhance variable-rate
long-term tax-exempt debt totaling $213 million, with maturities

Under the
terms of Generation’s and ComEd’s variable-rate
tax-exempt debt agreements, Generation or ComEd may be required to
repurchase the debt before its stated maturity unless supported by
sufficient letters of credit. If Generation or ComEd were required
to repurchase the debt, it would reassess its options to obtain new
letters of credit or remarket the bonds with an interest rate term
not requiring letter of credit support. Generation and ComEd have
classified amounts outstanding under these debt agreements as
long-term based on management’s intent and ability to either
renew or replace the letters of credit, or refinance the debt at
reasonable terms on a long-term fixed-rate basis. "

Debt In June 2009, PPG entered into a $400
million three year unsecured term loan. The proceeds will be used
to repay outstanding debt. During the second quarter $165 million
of the proceeds from this term loan were used to retire outstanding
amounts under our €650 million revolving credit
facility; the remainder of the loan proceeds will be used to retire
our 7.05% bonds, which are to mature in August of 2009 and to repay
additional amounts under our €650 million revolving
credit facility. The principal amount of this loan is due in three
years. The interest rate on borrowings under this facility is
variable based on a spread over LIBOR.
In December 2007, PPG issued $617
million of commercial paper and borrowed $1,056 million (€717
million) under a €1 billion bridge loan agreement with
multiple lenders and Credit Suisse as administrative agent for
those lenders. The proceeds from these borrowings were deposited
into escrow in December 2007. Upon closing of the SigmaKalon
acquisition on January 2, 2008, these amounts were released
from escrow and paid to the seller. Also, in January 2008, PPG
borrowed $1,143 million, representing the remaining $417 million
(€283 million) available under the €1 billion bridge
loan agreement and $726 million (€493 million) under its
three year €650 million revolving credit facility. The
proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand of $116 million
were used to refinance $1,259 million of the $1,517 million of
SigmaKalon debt outstanding on the date of acquisition.
On March 18, 2008, PPG completed a
public offering of $600 million in aggregate principal amount of
its 5.75% Notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”), $700
million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.65% Notes due 2018
(the “2018 Notes”) and $250 million in aggregate
principal amount of its 7.70% Notes due 2038 (the “2038
Notes” and, together with the 2013 Notes and the 2018 Notes,
the “Notes”). The Notes were offered by the Company
pursuant to its existing shelf registration. The proceeds of this
offering of $1,538 million (net of discount and issuance costs) and
additional borrowings of $195 million under the
€650 million revolving credit facility were used to
repay existing debt, including certain short-term debt and the
amounts outstanding under the €1 billion bridge loan. No
further amounts can be borrowed under the €1 billion bridge
loan. The discount and issuance costs related to the Notes, which
totaled $12 million, will be amortized to interest expense over the
respective lives of the Notes. "

Receivable Sales Facility In
May 2009, we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility for an
additional one year period under terms similar to those previously in place.
The renewed facility will expire in May 2010. The May 2009 renewal
increased the committed balance from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion,
although from time-to-time the available amount may be less than $1.1 billion
based on concentration limits and receivable eligibility requirements. Through
this facility, McKesson Corporation sells certain U.S. pharmaceutical trade
accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a wholly-owned and consolidated
subsidiary which then sells these receivables to a special purpose entity
(“SPE”), which is a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary
of McKesson Corporation that is consolidated in our financial statements.
This SPE then sells undivided interests in the receivables to third-party
purchaser groups, each of which includes commercial paper conduits (“Conduits”),
which are special purpose legal entities administered by financial institutions.
Sales of undivided interests in the receivables by the SPE to the Conduits
are accounted for as a sale in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,”
because we have relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, accounts
receivable sold under these transactions are excluded from receivables, net
in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Receivables sold
and receivables retained by the Company are carried at face value, which due
to the short-term nature of our accounts receivable and terms of the facility,
approximates fair value. McKesson receives cash in the amount of the face
value for the receivables sold. No gain or loss is recorded upon sale as fee
charges from the Conduits are based upon a floating yield rate and the period
the undivided interests remain outstanding. Fee charges from the Conduits
are accrued at the end of each month and are recorded within administrative
expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Should we
default under the accounts receivable sales facility, the Conduits are entitled
to receive only collections on receivables owned by the SPE. We
continue servicing the receivables sold. No servicing asset is recorded at
the time of sale because we do not receive any servicing fees from third parties
or other income related to servicing the receivables. We do not record any
servicing liability at the time of sale as the receivables collection period
is relatively short and the costs of servicing the receivables sold over the
servicing period are insignificant. Servicing costs are recognized as incurred
over the servicing period. Information
regarding our outstanding balances related to our interests in accounts receivable
sold or qualifying receivables retained is as follows: June
30, March 31, (In
millions) 2009 2009 Receivables sold outstanding (1) $ — $ — Receivables retained,
net of allowance for doubtful accounts 4,752 4,814 (1) Deducted from receivables, net in the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. The
following table summarizes the activity related to our interests in accounts
receivable sold: Quarter Ended June 30, (In millions) 2009 2008 Proceeds from accounts receivable sales $ — $ 1,200 Fees and charges (1) 2 1 (1) Recorded in operating
expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The
delinquency ratio for the qualifying receivables represented less than 1%
of the total qualifying receivables as of June 30, 2009 and March 31,
2009. Revolving Credit Facility We
have a syndicated $1.3 billion five-year, senior unsecured revolving
credit facility which expires in June 2012. Borrowings under this
credit facility bear interest based upon either a Prime rate or the London
Interbank Offering Rate. Total borrowings under this facility were nil and
$62 million for the first quarters of 2010 and 2009. As of June 30,
2009 and March 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under
this facility. Commercial Paper We
issued and repaid nil and $496 million in commercial paper for the
first quarters of 2010 and 2009. There were no commercial paper issuances
outstanding at June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009. Long-Term
Debt On February 12,
2009, we issued 6.50% notes due February 15, 2014 (the “2014
Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million
and 7.50% notes due February 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”)
in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. Interest is payable
on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on August 15,
2009. The 2014 Notes will mature on February 15, 2014 and the 2019
Notes will mature on February 15, 2019. We utilized net proceeds,
after offering expenses, of $693 million from the issuance of the
2014 Notes and 2019 Notes for general corporate purposes. "

2014 Senior Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion
price of approximately $31.875 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment as defined in
the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes. On the issuance date of the 2014
Senior Convertible Notes, the market price of
U. S. Steel’s common stock was below the stated
conversion price of $31.875 and therefore, there was no beneficial
conversion option to the holders. Based on the initial conversion
rate, the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes are convertible into
27,058,781 shares of U. S. Steel common stock. However, we reserved
33,824,000 shares, which is the maximum amount that could be issued
upon conversion. Other than receiving cash in lieu of fractional
shares, holders do not have the option to receive cash upon
conversion. If U. S. Steel undergoes a fundamental
change, as defined in the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes, holders
may require us to repurchase the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes in
whole or in part for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes to be purchased plus
any accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if
any) up to, but excluding the repurchase date. The 2014 Senior Convertible Notes
restrict our ability to create certain liens, to enter into sale
leaseback transactions, and to consolidate, merge or transfer all,
or substantially all, of our assets. Repayment of Term
Loans U. S. Steel used $655 million of the
net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes
and the issuance of common stock (see Note 13) to repay all amounts
outstanding under its three-year Term Loan due October 2010 and
five-year Term Loan due May 2012. The remaining net proceeds will
be used for general corporate purposes. Amended Credit
Agreement On June 12, 2009, U. S. Steel
entered into an amendment and restatement of its $750 million
Credit Agreement dated May 11, 2007 (Amended Credit Agreement)
which revised pricing and amended other customary terms and
conditions. U. S. Steel simultaneously entered into a security
agreement providing for a security interest in the majority of its
domestic inventory, certain accounts receivable and related
collateral. The Amended Credit Agreement
established a borrowing base formula, which limits the amounts U.
S. Steel can borrow to a certain percent of the value of certain
domestic inventory less specified reserves, and eliminates the
previous financial covenants that consisted of an interest coverage
ratio and a leverage ratio. The Amended Credit Agreement contains a
new financial covenant requiring U. S. Steel to maintain a fixed
charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement)
of at least 1.10 to 1.00 for the most recent four consecutive
quarters when availability under the Amended Credit Agreement is
less than the greater of 15% of the total aggregate commitments and
$112.5 million. Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank, an affiliate of
the former investment bank, withdrew from the facility in June of
2009, reducing availability under the Amended Credit Agreement to
$734.5 million. On July 20, 2009, the commitment previously
held by Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank was replaced by an existing
lender and the total availability under the facility increased to
$750 million. As of June 30, 2009, there were no
amounts drawn on the Amended Credit Agreement and our availability
was $734.5 million. We met the fixed charge coverage ratio test on
June 30, 2009. If current economic conditions continue, the
value or levels of inventory may decrease or we may not be able to
meet the fixed charge coverage ratio test in the future. Either or
both of those situations would affect our ability to borrow the
full amount of this facility. Other obligations At June 30, 2009, in the event of
a change in control of U. S. Steel, debt obligations
totaling $2,463 million, plus any sums then outstanding under
our $750 million Credit Facility may be declared immediately due
and payable. In such event, U. S. Steel may also be
required to either repurchase the leased Fairfield slab caster for
$44 million or provide a letter of credit to secure the remaining
obligation. In the event of the bankruptcy of
Marathon Oil Corporation (Marathon), $486 million of obligations
related to Environmental Revenue Bonds, the Fairfield Caster Lease
and the coke battery lease at the Clairton Plant may be declared
immediately due and payable. U. S. Steel Košice
(USSK) credit facilities At June 30, 2009, USSK had
€200 million (approximately $283 million)
borrowed against its three-year revolving unsecured credit
facility. At June 30, 2009, USSK had no
borrowings against its €40 million and €20 million credit facilities (which
approximated $85 million), but had $8 million of customs and other
guarantees outstanding, reducing availability to $77
million. U. S. Steel Serbia (USSS) credit
facility On September 25, 2008, USSS
entered into a series of agreements providing for a €50 million
(approximately $71 million) committed working capital facility that
is partially secured by USSS’s inventory of finished and
semi-finished goods. Interest on borrowings under the facility is
based on a spread over BELIBOR, EURIBOR or LIBOR. The agreements
contain customary terms and conditions and €10 million of the
agreements expire on August 31, 2009 with the remaining
€40 million
of the agreements expiring on August 31, 2010. At
June 30, 2009, there were no borrowings against this facility.
As of June 30, 2009, availability was $49 million under the
terms of the facility. "

At June 30, 2009, the total unamortized discount related to the fixed rate Senior Notes and Debentures and the note payable was $28 million and $18 million, respectively. Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at June 30, 2009, the carrying value of the Company’s Senior Notes and Debentures exceeded its fair market value by $250 million. The fair market value of the Company’s publicly traded debt was determined utilizing quoted market prices.At June 30, 2009, the outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average interest rate of 1.05% and an average remaining life of less than 30 days. The commercial paper is classified as long-term debt as the Company has the intent and ability, through utilization of its $3.25 billion revolving credit facility due December 2010, to refinance this debt. The Company’s credit facility contains typical covenants for an investment grade company. The one principal financial covenant requires the Company’s interest coverage for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters to be at least 3.0x, which it met at June 30, 2009. As of June 30, 2009, it was 6.7x."

320.7 $ 459.6 (a) In 2006, the Company entered into
several interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting $325.0 million
of fixed rate notes to variable rates. The weighted average effective interest
rate of these borrowings, including the effects of outstanding swaps as noted
in Note 10 was 5.3% as of December 31, 2008. In the first quarter
of 2009, $100 million in interest rate swaps related to the Company’s
2009 fixed rate debt matured and the Company terminated $150 million
in interest rate swap agreements related to the Company’s 2016 fixed
rate debt and $75 million of interest rate swap agreements related
to the Company’s 2019 fixed rate debt. As a result of the first
quarter 2009 swap terminations, a $34.5 million gain remained in
debt to be amortized over the remaining lives of the respective 2016 and 2019
debt. As of June 30, 2009, the unamortized portion was $33.2 million. The Company has a multi-currency revolving credit facility, which
provided for borrowings up to $600 million through July 22,
2009. On April 30, 2009, the Company extended its revolving credit
facility for 18 months, maturing January 22, 2011. The facility
was reduced to $250 million beginning July 23, 2009. The
facility is now secured by unperfected pledges of the Company’s
equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain assets. No secured party
is entitled to perfect its lien on any of the collateral until the long term
unsecured senior, non-credit enhanced debt rating of the Company is less than
or equal to BB+ by Standard & Poor’s and less
than or equal to Ba1 by Moody’s. The Company’s credit
rating as of June 30, 2009 was BBB by Standard & Poor’s
and Ba1 by Moody’s. The three key covenants of the credit agreement
are a net worth test, a debt compared to EBITDA (“Earnings Before
Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”) test, and an interest
coverage test. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at June 30,
2009 and expects to remain compliant in future periods. At June 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under
the facility. The Company’s 6.5% Senior Notes of $136.7 million
matured on February 17, 2009. The Company had outstanding letters
of credit at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 of $15.2 million
and $21.4 million, respectively. The letters of credit typically act as a
guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified
terms and conditions. On April 9, 2009, the Company issued $373.8 million
in convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012. Under FASB Staff
Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments
That May be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
(“FSP APB 14-1”), the Company must account for the convertible
senior notes by bifurcating the instrument between their liability and equity
components. The value of the debt component is based on the fair value of
issuing a similar nonconvertible debt security. The equity component of the
convertible debt security is calculated by deducting the value of the liability
from the proceeds received at issuance. Therefore, the Company’s
June 30, 2009 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an increase
in debt of $321.7 million and an increase in capital in excess of
par of $34.6 million. Additionally, FSP APB 14-1 requires us to accrete
the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face value
over the term of the notes. The Company’s interest expense associated
with this bond accretion is based on the effective interest rate of the convertible
senior notes of 9.365%. The total interest expense related to the convertible
notes in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations was
$7.4 million for the second quarter, of which $4.2 million
was non-cash. For the full year of 2009, interest expense related to the convertible
notes will be approximately $22.5 million, of which approximately $12.8 million
will be non-cash. The notes will pay interest semi-annually of $6.5 million,
which is at a coupon rate of 3.50% per year, beginning in October of this
year. Holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option at any
time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately
preceding the maturity date of the notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal
amount. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 30.4706 shares of the
Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (representing
an initial conversion price of approximately $32.82 per share of common stock).
The conversion price represents a conversion premium of 27.5% over the last
reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange on April 6, 2009, of $25.74 per share. As of June 30,
2009, the if-converted value of the 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes was approximately
$15.2 million. In conjunction with the note offering, the Company
entered into a bond hedge overlay at a net pre-tax cost of $25.2 million,
effectively raising the conversion premium to 50.0%, or approximately $38.61
per share. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of
our common stock or a combination thereof at our election. The convertible
senior notes were issued under the Company’s $750 million
universal shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
leaving approximately $376 million available as of June 30,
2009. As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the estimated
fair values of the Company’s senior unsecured notes totaled $743.1 million
and $532.3 million, respectively. The estimated fair values were
$19.1 million higher at June 30, 2009 and $6.7 million
lower at December 31, 2008 than their respective carrying values.
Fair market values are developed by the use of estimates obtained from brokers
and other appropriate valuation techniques based on information available
as of quarter-end and year-end. The fair value estimates do not necessarily
reflect the values the Company could realize in the current markets. "

The revolving credit facility (none of which was outstanding as of June 30, 2009) is available for general corporate purposes. During the first six month of 2009,we made scheduled payments of $160.0 million on the Term A loan. The maturity date of the credit facility is October 14, 2010.
The credit facility requires us to pay interest periodically on the London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) or base rate options, plus a margin. The margin over LIBOR will range from 0.50% to 1.125%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or our credit rating. Under the credit facility we are required to pay commitmentfees on the unused portion of the $600.0 million revolving credit facility. The commitment fee will range from 0.10% to 0.25% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or our credit rating.At June 30, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on the facility was 1.4%. The credit facility contains covenants which limit the indebtedness we may incur, the common shares we may repurchase, and dividends we may pay. The repurchase and dividend covenant applies if certain leverage thresholds are exceeded. Thecovenants also include a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. At June 30, 2009, we believe we are in compliance with all covenants associated with our credit facility.On June 9, 2009, we issued $2.5 billion of Senior Notes, including $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Notes due 2012; $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Senior Notes due 2014 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.250% Senior Notes due 2019. The Senior Notes require interest to be paidsemi-annually on June 15 and December 15. We may redeem some or all of each series of Senior Notes prior to maturity at a price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of any notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest; or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes being redeemed, not including unpaid interest accruedto the redemption date, discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the treasury ra

In addition, if the Acquisition Agreement is terminated for any reason we will be required to redeem the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 101%of the stated principal amount, plus unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Senior Notes are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by most of our current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. 11 Financing costs of $13.3 million, for the issuance of the Senior Notes, are being amortized over an average weighted period of 5.2 years and are reflected in other intangible assets, net in the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet. We intend to use the net proceeds for the acquisition of WellPoint’s NextRx pharmacybenefit management business (see Note 3). We entered into a commitment letter with a syndicate of commercial banks for an unsecured, 364-day, $2.5 billion term loan credit facility in order to finance the NextRx acquisition.

credit facilities, as amended, are comprised of a $600.0 million

revolving line of credit, which can be utilized to provide up to $300.0 million
in letters of credit, expiring on August 10, 2012. We hereinafter
refer to these credit facilities collectively as our Credit Facilities. At
both June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had no amounts
outstanding under the revolving line of credit. We had outstanding letters
of credit of $112.1 million and $104.2 million at June 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, which reduced borrowing
capacity to $287.9 million and $295.8 million, respectively.
The interbank market for our Term Loan implied a fair value of approximately
$525 million at June 30, 2009 and $495 million at December 31,
2008, as compared with a carrying value of $546.9 million and $549.7 million
at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Borrowings
under our Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option,
either (1) the base rate (which is based on the greater of the prime
rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under our Credit
Facilities or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%) or (2) London Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin determined by
reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated Earnings Before Interest,
Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), which
as of June 30, 2009 was 0.875% and 1.50% for borrowings under our
revolving line of credit and term loan, respectively. We
may prepay loans under our Credit Facilities in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty. During the three and six months ended June 30,
2009, we made scheduled repayments under our Credit Facilities of $1.4 million
and $2.8 million, respectively. We have scheduled repayments under
our Credit Facilities of $1.4 million due in each of the next four
quarters. European
Letter of Credit Facility On
September 14, 2007, we entered into a 364-day unsecured European
Letter of Credit Facility (“European LOC Facility”), to
issue letters of credit in an aggregate face amount not to exceed €150.0 million
at any time. The initial commitment of €80.0 million
was increased to €110.0 million
upon renewal in September 2008. The aggregate commitment of the European
LOC Facility may be increased up to €150.0 million
as may be agreed among the parties, and may be decreased by us at our option
without any premium, fee or penalty. The European LOC Facility is used for
contingent obligations solely in respect of surety and performance bonds,
bank guarantees and similar obligations. We had outstanding letters of credit
drawn on the European LOC Facility of €82.9 million
($116.3 million) and €104.0 million
($145.2 million) as of June 30, 2009 and December 31,

Both Short-term investments and
Fixed Income Investments, held to maturity are comprised
primarily of money market funds, eurodollar time deposits,
certificates of deposits, commercial paper, euro notes and
Eurobonds, and are substantially denominated in US dollars. The
carrying value of these investments approximates fair value, which
was estimated using quoted market prices for those or similar
investments.

2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023. On
June 1, 2010, holders may require Schlumberger to repurchase
their Series B debentures for cash. Accordingly, these debentures
are classified within Current Liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2009. The fair
value of these Series B debentures at June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008 was $474 million and $398 million,
respectively. For further information regarding the debentures
refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in the Schlumberger Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2008.
The fair value of Schlumberger’s
fixed rate Long-Term Debt was estimated based on quoted
market prices.
During the first quarter of 2009, a
subsidiary of Schlumberger entered into a €3.0 billion Euro
Medium Term Note program which is guaranteed by Schlumberger
Limited. This program provides for the issuance of various types of
debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US
dollar or other currencies. Schlumberger issued €1.0 billion
4.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2014 in the second quarter under this
program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these Euro
notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity,
effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which
Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of
4.95%. "

Debt Second Quarter In the second quarter of 2009, we issued $250 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes and $100 million of 7% senior unsecured notes for net proceeds of approximately $248 million and $98 million, respectively. The 6.625% notes mature on May 15, 2019 and the 7% notes mature on May 15, 2024. We may redeem these debentures at any time. Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was $2.0 billion at June 30, 2009 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2008. First Quarter In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded the impact of a capital lease obligation associated with a manufacturing facility in our Display Technologies segment. The balance of this obligation at March 31, 2009 was $141 million and is included in our long-term debt balance. Corning repaid $72 million of debt which included the redemption of $54 million principal amount of our 6.3% notes due March 1, 2009.

Credit Facilities The
Company’s senior credit agreement consists of $2,280 million
of US dollar-denominated and €400 million of Euro-denominated
term loans due 2014, a $600 million revolving credit facility terminating
in 2013 and a $228 million credit-linked revolving facility terminating
in 2014. Borrowings under the senior credit agreement bear interest at a variable
interest rate based on LIBOR (for US dollars) or EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable,
or, for US dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate,
in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the term
loans and any loans under the credit-linked revolving facility is 1.75%, subject
to potential reductions as defined in the senior credit agreement. As of June 30,
2009 the applicable margin was 1.75%. The term loans under the senior credit
agreement are subject to amortization at 1% of the initial principal amount
per annum, payable quarterly. The remaining principal amount of the term loans
is due on April 2, 2014. As
of June 30, 2009, there were $89 million of letters of credit
issued under the credit-linked revolving facility and $139 million
remained available for borrowing. As of June 30, 2009, there were
no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving
credit facility. On
June 30, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to the senior
credit agreement. The amendment reduced the amount available under the revolving
credit portion of the senior credit agreement from $650 million to
$600 million and increased the first lien senior secured leverage
ratio covenant that is applicable when any amount is outstanding under the
revolving credit portion of the senior credit agreement as set forth below.
Prior to giving effect to the amendment, the maximum first lien senior secured
leverage ratio was 3.90 to 1.00. As amended, the maximum senior secured leverage
ratio for the following trailing four-quarter periods is as follows: First
Lien Senior Secured Leverage Ratio June 30,
2009................................................. 4.75 to
1.00 September 30,

2010....................................... 4.25 to
1.00 December 31,
2010 and thereafter.............. 3.90 to
1.00 As
a condition to borrowing funds or requesting that letters of credit be issued
under that facility, the Company’s first lien senior secured leverage
ratio (as calculated as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter
for which financial statements have been delivered under the revolving facility)
cannot exceed a certain threshold as specified above. The first lien senior
secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated first lien
senior secured debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
subject to adjustment identified in the credit agreement. Based
on the estimated first lien senior secured leverage ratio for the trailing
four quarters at June 30, 2009, the Company’s borrowing
capacity under the revolving credit facility is currently $600 million.
Further, the Company’s first lien senior secured leverage ratio
must be maintained at or below that threshold while any amounts are outstanding
under the revolving credit facility. As of the quarter ended June 30,
2009, the Company estimates its first lien senior secured leverage ratio to
be 3.80 to 1.00 (which would be 4.59 to 1.00 were the revolving credit facility
fully drawn). The maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio under the
revolving credit facility for such quarter is 4.75 to 1.00. The
Company’s senior credit agreement also contains a number of restrictions
on certain of its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, restrictions
on their ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate,
or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make investments;
prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates;
enter into sale-leaseback transactions or hedge transactions; or engage in
other businesses. The senior credit agreement also contains a number of affirmative
covenants and events of default, including a cross default to other debt of
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries in an aggregate amount equal
to more than $40 million and the occurrence of a change of control.
Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event
of default, could result in acceleration of the loans and other financial
obligations under the Company’s senior credit agreement. The
senior credit agreement is guaranteed by Celanese Holdings LLC, a subsidiary
of Celanese Corporation, and certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company’s
subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC (“Celanese US”),
a Delaware limited liability company, and is secured by a lien on substantially
all assets of Celanese US and such subsidiaries, subject to certain agreed
exceptions, pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated as of
April 2, 2007, by and among Celanese Holdings LLC, Celanese US, certain
subsidiaries of Celanese US and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as Administrative
Agent and as Collateral Agent. The
Company is in compliance with all of the covenants related to its debt agreements
as of June 30, 2009. /*<![CDATA[*/ <!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal,

On March 26, 2009, TWC completed an offering of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities and used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to prepay in full the outstanding loans a
nd all other amounts due under the TWC Bridge Facility, and the TWC Bridge Facility was terminated in accordance with its terms. Concurrently with the termination of the TWC Bridge Facility and pursuant to the terms of the $1.535 billion credit agreement (the “Supplemental Credit Agreement”) between the Company (as lender) and TWC (as borrower) for a two-year senior unsecured supplemental term loan facility (the “Supplemental Credit Facility”), on March 26, 2009, TWC terminated the commitments of Time Warner under the Supplemental Credit Facility, and the Supplemental Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms.Amendments to Revolving FacilityOn March 11, 2009, the Company entered into the first and second amendments to the amended and restated credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) for its senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility
”). The first amendment terminated the $100 million commitment of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (“LCPI”), a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in September 2008, reducing the committed amount of the Revolving Facility from $7.0 billion to $6.9 billion. The second amendment, among other things, amended the Revolving Credit Agreement to (i) expand the circumstances under which any other lender under the Revolving Facility would become a Defaulting Lender (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended) and (ii) permit Time Warner to terminate the commitment of any such lender on terms substantially similar to those applicable to LCPI under the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement. Consent SolicitationOn April 15, 2009, the Company completed a solicitation of consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) from the holders of the debt securities (the “Securities”) issued by Time Warner Inc. and its subsidiaries under all of the indentures governing the publicly traded debt securities of the Company and its subsidiaries other than the indenture entered into in November 2006 (collectively, the “Indentures”). Completion of the Consent Solicitation resulted in the adoption on April 16, 2009 of certain amendments to each Indenture that provide that certain restrictive covenants will not apply (subject to the concurrent or prior issuance of the guarantee by HBO discussed below) to a conveyance or transfer by AOL LLC of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety, unless such conveyance or transfer constitutes a conveyance or transfer of the properties and assets of the issuer and the guarantors under the relevant Indenture and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, substantially as an entirety. As a result of the Consent Solicitation, prior to or concurrent with a conveyance or transfer of AOL LLC’s properties and assets substantially as an entirety, HBO will issue a guarantee of the obligations of Historic TW Inc. (“Historic TW”) (including in its capacity as successor to Time Warner Companies, Inc.), whether as issuer or guarantor, under the Indentures and the Securities. Such guarantee will be issued by HBO only in connection with such a transaction.Shelf Registration StatementTime Warner had a shelf registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) on file with the SEC since November 8, 2006 that allowed it to offer and sell from time to time debt securities, preferred stock, common stock and/or warrants to purchase debt and equity securities. As a result of the Company’s $13.955 billion of unused committed capacity at March 31, 2009 and the anticipated expiration in early November 2009 of the Registration Statement, the Company determined it no longer need
ed the Registration Statement. Accordingly, on April 24, 2009, the Company and the subsidiary guarantors under the Registration Statement submitted filings to the SEC that suspended the reporting obligations with respect to the debt securities (and related guarantees) that were offered and sold pursuant to the Registration Statement and deregistered the securities covered under the Registration Statement that were available for offer and sale."

we repurchased $300.0 and $400.0, respectively, of our $1,090.0
face value due at maturity zero coupon notes. The notes were issued
in August 2007 in a private placement transaction. We paid cash
totaling $351.1 to repurchase the notes, which had a remaining
carrying value of $193.4 at June 30, 2009 and were classified
in current portion of long-term debt. In July 2009, we paid cash of
$195.9 to repurchase the remaining balance of the notes. On February 5, 2009, we
issued $400.0 of 6.000% notes due 2014 and $600.0 of 7.000% notes
due 2019 under our shelf registration statement. The proceeds from
this debt issuance have been used for general corporate purposes,
including, but not limited to, repayment of current maturities of
long-term debt and repurchasing shares of our common stock. The
notes have a call feature that allows us to repurchase the notes at
any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder
to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of both a
change of control event and a downgrade of the notes. We have a senior revolving
credit facility, or the facility, with certain lenders for general
corporate purposes. The facility, as amended, provides credit up to
$2,392.0, which matures on September 30, 2011. The interest
rate on this facility is based on either (i) the LIBOR rate
plus a predetermined percentage rate based on our credit rating at
the date of utilization, or (ii) a base rate as defined in the
facility agreement. Our ability to borrow under this facility is
subject to compliance with certain covenants. There were no amounts
outstanding under this facility as of June 30, 2009 or during
the three or six months then ended. At June 30, 2009, we had
$2,392.0 available under this facility. We have an authorized
commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds of which
may be used for general corporate purposes. At June 30, 2009,
we had $648.2 outstanding under this program. Commercial paper
borrowings have been classified as long-term debt at June 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008 in accordance with FAS No. 6,
Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to be
Refinanced, as our practice and intent is to replace short-term
commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional
short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending
for more than one year or our ability to redeem our commercial
paper with borrowings under the senior credit facility described
above. We are a member of the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Cincinnati, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member we
have the ability to obtain cash advances subject to certain
requirements. In order to obtain cash advances, we are required to
pledge securities as collateral to the FHLBs, initially equal to a
certain percentage of the cash borrowings, depending on the type of
securities pledged as collateral. The market value of the
collateral is monitored daily by the FHLBs, and if it falls below
the required percentage of the cash borrowings, we are required to
pledge additional securities as collateral or repay a portion of
the outstanding cash advance balance. In addition, our borrowings
may be limited based on the amount of our investment in the
FHLBs’ common stock. Our investment in the FHLBs’
common stock at June 30, 2009 totaled $7.5, which is reported
in “Investments available-for-sale – Equity
securities” on the consolidated balance sheets. At
June 30, 2009, $100.0 of cash advances from the FHLBs was
outstanding and is reported in “Short-term borrowings”
on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities, primarily certain
U.S. government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a fair
value of $125.2 at June 30, 2009, have been pledged as
collateral. The securities pledged are reported in
“Investments available-for-sale – Fixed maturity

7,968 Certain of the Company’s
credit facilities and long-term debt agreements have restrictive covenants
and cross-default provisions which generally provide, subject to the Company’s
right to cure, for the acceleration of payments due in the event of a breach
of the covenant or a default in the payment of a specified amount of indebtedness
due under certain other debt agreements. The Company was in compliance with
all such covenants and provisions for all periods presented. In May 2009,
the Company issued $1,000 in senior notes, which rank equally with all of
the Company’s other senior unsecured indebtedness. In conjunction
with the debt issuance, the Company paid off $191 of 7.50% Debentures due
May 2037 that contained put options exercised in May 2009,
early redeemed $60 of 6.77% Medium Term Notes due July 2009 and purchased
pursuant to a tender offer $232 of 7.875% Notes due August 2009,
$177 of 6.95% Notes due August 2009 and $110 of 8.35% Notes due May 2010
for an aggregate payment of $777 in cash. The remainder of the debt issuance
proceeds was used to reduce the Revolving Credit Facility. In May 2009,
the Company amended and extended its 364-day accounts receivable securitization
program. The Company can borrow up to $200 on a revolving basis, with borrowings
secured by eligible accounts receivable, which remain under the Company’s
control. Facility fees under this program range from 0.75 percent
to 2.50 percent, based on the Company’s credit ratings.
The facility fee in effect on June 20, 2009, based on the Company’s
current credit ratings, is 1.00 percent. As of June 20, 2009, there
were $353 of accounts receivable pledged as collateral, classified in Receivables
in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the Company’s
intent to renew the facility or refinance it with the Revolving Credit Facility,
the facility is classified in Long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets. As of June 20, 2009, the Company had $456 of
debt, excluding the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, with current
maturities that are classified in Long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets due to the Company’s intent to refinance such obligations
with the Revolving Credit Facility or other long-term debt. "

Financing The size of the Company’s total commercial paper program
remains $1.2 billion and is supported by the revolving credit agreement
described below. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at June 30,
2009 and 2008 totaled $89.6 million and $526.2 million,
respectively, with an average interest rate and average term of 0.2% and 13 days,
and 2.2% and 27 days, respectively. These total borrowings are classified
as current notes payable in the consolidated balance sheet. Commercial paper
borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008 totaled $70.0 million,
with an average interest rate and average term of 1.4% and 29 days. On September 12,
2008 the Company closed on two new revolving credit facility agreements totaling
$1.15 billion collectively (the “new credit facility”)
to replace the existing $1.2 billion five-year credit facility that was to
expire on July 20, 2009. The new credit facility is with a syndicate
of fourteen banks led by JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. The existing
credit facility was cancelled after the new facility became effective. The new credit facility
consists of two separate tranches, a $383.3 million 364-day facility
that will terminate on September 11, 2009 and a $766.7 million
3-year facility that will terminate on September 12, 2011. The Company
pays a commitment fee of 8-17.5 basis points for the 364-day facility and
a commitment fee of 10-20 basis points for the 3-year facility, depending
upon the credit rating of the Company, whether or not amounts have been borrowed.
At the Company’s current credit rating, the commitment fee is 8
basis points for the 364-day facility and 10 basis points for the 3-year facility.
The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is, at the Company’s
option, based on (i) a spread over the prevailing London Inter-Bank
Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) that is calculated by multiplying
the current 30 business day average of the CDX 5-year investment grade index
by a percentage, ranging from 50-100% that is based on the Company’s
credit rating (“LIBOR loans”), which at the Company’s
current credit rating, the borrowing rate would be 50% of this index, with
a minimum spread of 0.5%, or (ii) on the higher of prime, which is
the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or 0.5%
plus the Federal funds rate (“ABR loans”). The Company has the option
at the termination of the 364-day facility to convert any revolving loans
outstanding into term loans for an additional year. Term loans can be LIBOR
loans or ABR loans and would carry an additional spread of 0.35%. The new credit facility
contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that the
Company not exceed indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in the new
credit facility, of 4 to 1. This covenant is similar to the previous credit
agreements and has never been exceeded. There were no borrowings under either
of the facilities as of June 30, 2009, December 31, 2008 and June 30,
2008. The Company has the capacity
to issue Extendible Commercial Notes (“ECNs”) of up to
$240 million, provided that sufficient investor demand for ECNs exists. ECNs
replicate commercial paper, except that the Company has an option to extend
the note beyond its initial redemption date to a maximum final maturity of
390 days. However, if exercised, such an extension is at a higher
reset rate, which is at a predetermined spread over LIBOR and is related to
the Company’s commercial paper rating at the time of extension.
As a result of the extension option, no backup facilities for these borrowings
are required. As is the case with commercial paper, ECNs have no financial
covenants. There were no ECN borrowings outstanding as of June 30,
2009, December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008. In the current
credit environment, the ECN market is not available and the Company has no
plans to utilize this market. On April 19, 2007, the Company signed a promissory note
with one of its providers of banking services to enable the Company to borrow
additional funds, on an uncommitted basis, from time to time to supplement
its commercial paper and ECN borrowings. The specific terms (principal, interest
rate and maturity date) of each borrowing governed by this promissory note
are determined on the borrowing date of each loan. These borrowings have no
financial covenants. There were no promissory note borrowings outstanding
as of June 30, 2009, December 31, 2008 and June 30,
2008. In the current credit environment, the market for these instruments
is currently not available and the Company has no plans to utilize them in
the short-term. On January 1, 2009, the Company transferred most of Standard
& Poor’s U.S. properties and assets from a division to
a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary. This reorganization was initiated
to address future operational and financial conditions, and will not affect
the ongoing conduct of Standard & Poor’s businesses, including
the credit ratings business. In conjunction with this reorganization, a series of supplemental
agreements were executed. They include a supplemental indenture for the Company’s
$1.2 billion senior notes (three tranches of $400 million
due in 2012, 2017 and 2037), amendments to the company’s current
$1.15 billion Credit Agreement (including both the 364-day and the
3-year agreements), amendments to the commercial paper issuing and paying
agency agreement (with JP Morgan Chase) and amended and restated commercial
paper dealer agreements (with JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Merrill
Lynch). All of these agreements and amendments provide that the new S&P
subsidiary will guarantee the senior notes issued pursuant to the indenture,
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement and the commercial paper. Long-term debt was $1,197.7 million,
$1,197.6 million and $1,197.5 million as of June 30,
2009, December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008, respectively.
The carrying amount of the Company’s borrowings approximates fair
value at June 30, 2009. The Company paid interest on its debt totaling
$25.0 million and $26.9 million during the three months
ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $35.8 million
and $34.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009
and 2008, respectively. In the second quarter of 2008, cash was utilized to repurchase approximately
3.3 million shares for $141.5 million on a settlement date
basis. An additional 0.7 million shares were repurchased in the second
quarter of 2008, which settled in July 2008. Accordingly, the Company
recorded a liability of $29.2 million, classified in other current
liabilities at June 30, 2008. "

short-term borrowings and long-term debt, see Note 10 to Hospiras consolidated
financial statements included in Hospiras Annual Report on Form 10-K for

$5.0 million in principal outstanding as of December 31, 2008, under
the $500.0 million three-year term loan facility due March 2010, was
paid. Beginning in March 2009, the $375.0 million principal amount of
floating rate notes are classified as short-term borrowings as they mature in
March 2010. In May 2009,
Hospira issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.40% notes which
are due May 15, 2015, with interest due semi-annually, for general
corporate purposes. This issuance contains covenants consistent with current
borrowings. In June 2009, Hospira repaid in full the $300.0 million
aggregate principal amount of 4.95% notes upon maturity. Hospira has a five-year $375.0 million unsecured
revolving credit facility (the Revolver) expiring in December 2010. The Revolver is available for working capital and other requirements.
As of June 30, 2009, Hospira had no amounts outstanding under
the Revolver. Certain borrowing agreements contain covenants
that require compliance with, among other restrictions, a maximum leverage ratio
and a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of June 30, 2009, Hospira was in
compliance with all applicable covenants. "

(525.0) (1) After the effect
of interest rate hedging, the average annual borrowing rate for
outstanding revolving and term loans was 3.37% and 5.10% as of
June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. (2) As of
June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, no revolving loans
were drawn under the credit facility; however, the principal amount
of letter of credit obligations totaled $18.8 million and $21.5
million, respectively, reducing available borrowing capacity to
$581.2 million and $578.5 million, respectively. The terms of the
private placement senior notes and the credit facility each contain
customary covenants that require compliance with certain financial
covenants based on: (1) debt to earnings ratio and
(2) interest coverage ratio. As of June 30, 2009, we were
in compliance with the financial covenants in both the note
purchase agreement and the credit agreement. However, if the
current economic crisis continues, leading to further decline in
steel demand and pricing, or we experience significant unfavorable
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, it is reasonably
possible that our ability to remain in compliance with these
financial covenants could be impacted in the near term. Such
circumstances could require the use of higher cost forms of
capital. Short-term Facilities
On February 9,
2009, Asia Pacific Iron Ore amended its A$40 million ($32.2
million) multi-option facility. The original facility provided
credit for short-term working capital and contingent instruments,
such as performance bonds. The amended facility includes an
additional A$80 million ($64.4 million) cash facility, which
matures in August 2009. The outstanding bank commitments on the
A$40 million multi-option facility totaled A$26.8 million ($21.6
million) and A$27.2 million ($18.8 million) in performance bonds,
reducing borrowing capacity to A$13.2 million ($10.6 million) and
A$12.8 million ($8.8 million) at June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. As of June 30, 2009,
there were no funds drawn under the cash facility. The facility
agreement contains financial covenants as follows: (1) debt to
earnings ratio and (2) interest coverage ratio. The amendments
to the facility did not cause any change to the financial covenants
in place. As of June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the
financial covenants of the credit facility agreement. We have
provided a guarantee of the combined facilities, along with certain
of our Australian subsidiaries.
Latin America
At June 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, Amapá had total project debt
outstanding of approximately $530 million and $493 million,
respectively, for which we have provided a several guarantee on our
30 percent share. Our estimate of the aggregate fair value of the
outstanding guarantee is $6.7 million as of June 30, 2009,
which is reflected in Other Liabilities on the Statements of
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position. Amapá is
currently in violation of certain operating and financial loan
covenants contained in the debt agreements. However, Amapá and
its lenders have agreed to extend the suspension of these covenants
with the exception of debt to equity ratio requirements through
October 2009. If Amapá is unable to either renegotiate the
terms of the debt agreements or obtain further extension of the
compliance waivers, violation of the operating and financial loan
covenants may result in the lenders calling the debt, thereby
requiring us to recognize and repay our share of the debt in
accordance with the provisions of the guarantee
arrangement.

) In March
2009, we extinguished $500 million of 4.38 percent notes due in
September 2009. As a result of this extinguishment, we recorded a
net loss of $9 million ($6 million net of tax), which is included
in interest expense, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of

percent note due in 2013. In connection with the issuance of this
note, we entered into a fixed rate cross-currency swap agreement
designated as a cash flow hedge with a maturity corresponding to
the underlying debt (refer to Note 6). (G) In June
2009, we paid $28 million to repurchase zero coupon notes with a
par value totaling $50 million and unamortized discounts of $30
million. As a result of these extinguishments, we recorded a net
loss of $8 million ($5 million net of tax), which is included in
interest expense, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of
Operations and presented as a net cash outflow in the financing
section of our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash

amounts are shown net of unamortized discounts of $289 million and
$327 million as of July 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. (I) These
amounts represent the present value of our minimum capital lease
payments as of July 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. (J) At
July 3, 2009, approximately $801 million of our outstanding
debt was issued by our subsidiaries and guaranteed by
CCE. (K) The total
fair value of our debt was $9.8 billion and $9.0 billion at
July 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The
fair value of our debt is determined using quoted market prices for
publicly traded instruments, and for non-publicly traded
instruments through a variety of valuation techniques depending on
the specific characteristics of the debt instrument, taking into
account credit risk. Debt and Credit
Facilities We have amounts available to
us for borrowing under various debt and credit facilities. These
facilities serve as a backstop to our commercial paper programs and
support our working capital needs. Our primary committed facility
matures in 2012 and is a $2.5 billion multi-currency credit
facility with a syndicate of 17 banks. At July 3, 2009, our
availability under this credit facility was $2.2 billion. The
amount available is limited by the aggregate outstanding borrowings
and letters of credit issued under the facility. Based on
information currently available to us, we have no indication that
the financial institutions syndicated under this facility would be
unable to fulfill their commitments to us as of the date of the
filing of this report. Amounts available for borrowing under
additional committed credit facilities totaled approximately $20
million as of July 3, 2009. We also have uncommitted
amounts available under a public debt facility, which could be used
for long-term financing and to refinance debt maturities and
commercial paper. The amounts available under this public debt
facility and the related costs to borrow are subject to market
conditions at the time of borrowing.
Covenants Our credit facilities and
outstanding notes and debentures contain various provisions that,
among other things, require us to limit the incurrence of certain
liens or encumbrances in excess of defined amounts. Additionally,
our credit facilities require that our net debt to total capital
ratio does not exceed a defined amount. We were in compliance with
these requirements as of July 3, 2009. These requirements
currently are not, and it is not anticipated they will become,
restrictive to our liquidity or capital resources. "

credit facility expiring in 2012 to add Covidien plc as a
guarantor. In addition, the credit facility was amended such that
borrowings under the facility now bear interest, at the
Company’s option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin
dependent on the Company’s credit default swap rate (subject to a floor and a cap
that is dependent upon the Company’s credit ratings). Prior
to this amendment, the margin was dependent on the Company’s

At June 30, 2009, the Company had credit facilities with various U.S. and foreign banks totaling approximately $800 million. These credit facilities consist of a $700 million revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""), as well as a 60 million euro credit facility (""Euro Facility""). The Credit Facility has two tranches,with $125 million expiring in 2012 and $575 million expiring in 2013. The Euro Facility expires in 2012. Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. The Credit Facility requires a facility fee on the total commitment. In addition, these credit facilities c
ontain a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was incompliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At June 30, 2009, the Company's credit facility borrowings totaled $84 million at an effective interest rate of 1.29 percent. At December 31, 2008, the Company's credit facility borrowings totaled $84 million at an effective interest rate of 3.74 percent.
The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Given the expiration dates of the Credit Facility, any commercial paper borrowings supported bythe Credit Facility are classified as long-term borrowings because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such borrowings on a long-term basis."

13,555 We were in compliance
with all provisions and covenants of our borrowings as of June 30, 2009. Effective January 1,
2009, we adopted FSP APB 14-1 (ASC 470-20). This FSP requires issuers of
convertible debt that may be settled fully or partially in cash upon conversion
to account separately for the liability and equity components of the convertible
debt. The carrying amount of the equity component of our 3.50% Convertible
Senior Notes was $164 million as of June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008. At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the
liability component of these notes had a principal amount of $1.265 billion
at both dates; an unamortized discount value of $78 million and
$104 million, respectively; and a net carrying amount of
$1.187 billion and $1.161 billion, respectively. The remaining
discount will be amortized over the next 16 months. The effective interest
rate on our 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes is 8.77%. The interest expense,
inclusive of the 3.50% coupon and amortization of the discount and debt issuance
costs are recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 was
$26 million and $51 million, respectively. The interest expense,
inclusive of the 3.50% coupon and amortization of the discount and debt issuance
costs, recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 was
$24 million and $49 million, respectively. The holders of our 3.50%
Convertible Senior Notes have the option to require us to repurchase their notes
for cash every five years on November 15, beginning in 2010, and receive
cash from us equal to the par value of the notes. We believe that, if the
trading price of our common stock is below the conversion price on
November 15, 2010, the likelihood of holders requiring us to repurchase
their notes will increase the more the conversion price exceeds the trading
price of our common stock. The conversion value of the notes as of June 30,
2009 was calculated by using the current conversion rate of 191.2981 per $1,000
in principal amount of the notes or a conversion price of $5.23, adjusted for
certain events, including the payment of dividends, as described in the
indenture governing the notes. Repayment On January 2, 2009,
we redeemed $230 million aggregate principal amount of QCII's Floating Rate
Senior Notes due 2009. New Issuance In April 2009, our wholly
owned subsidiary, Qwest Corporation (""QC""), issued approximately
$811 million of 8.375% Senior Notes due 2016. QC is using the net proceeds
of $738 million for general corporate purposes, including repayment of
indebtedness and funding and refinancing investments in its telecommunication
assets. Credit Facility In April 2009, in
connection with the addition of a new lender to our revolving credit facility
(referred to as the Credit Facility), the amount available to us under the
Credit Facility increased from $850 million to $910 million. In July
2009, in connection with a $35 million increase in commitment by an
existing lender to the Credit Facility, the amount available to us under the
Credit Facility increased from $910 million to $945 million. The
Credit Facility is currently undrawn and expires in October 2010. Any amounts
drawn on the Credit Facility are guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiary, QSC,
and are secured by a senior lien on the stock of QC. "

The notes are due March 1, 2019, and pay interest semi-annually at 81⁄4%. Debt issuance costs of approximately $2 million were incurred and are being amortized to expense over the life of the debt issue.

2,2009-07-30,732712,XBRL," 6. Debt Verizon Wireless On December 19, 2008,
Verizon Wireless and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC, as the
borrowers, entered into a $17.0 billion credit facility (Bridge
Facility). On January 9, 2009, Verizon Wireless borrowed $12.4
billion under the Bridge Facility in order to complete the
acquisition of Alltel and repay certain of Alltel’s
outstanding debt as described below. Through June 30, 2009,
Verizon Wireless used cash generated from operations and the net
proceeds from the sale of the notes described below to repay all of
the borrowings under the Bridge Facility. As of June 30, 2009,
no borrowings were outstanding under the Bridge Facility and the
commitments under the Bridge Facility have been
terminated. In connection with the Alltel
acquisition, Verizon Wireless assumed approximately $23.9 billion
of debt, of which approximately $2.3 billion remains outstanding to
third parties as of June 30, 2009. Under the terms of a tender
offer that was completed on March 20, 2009, $0.2 billion
aggregate principal amount was redeemed for a loss that was not
significant. In February 2009, Verizon
Wireless and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC co-issued $4.3 billion
aggregate principal amount of three and five-year fixed rate notes
in a private placement resulting in cash proceeds of $4.2 billion,
net of discounts and issuance costs. In May 2009, Verizon Wireless
and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC co-issued $4.0 billion aggregate
principal amount of two-year fixed and floating rate notes in a
private placement resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $4.0
billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. In June 2009, Verizon
Wireless issued in a private placement $1.0 billion aggregate
principal amount of floating rate notes due 2011. Commencing on
December 27, 2009 and on each interest payment date
thereafter, both the note holders and Verizon Wireless have the
right to require settlement of all or a portion of these notes at
par. Accordingly, these notes are classified as current maturities
in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Cellco Partnership (d/b/a
Verizon Wireless) and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC filed a
registration statement with the SEC on July 6, 2009 to
register a total of approximately $11.8 billion of new notes which
may, once the registration statement is declared effective by
the SEC, be exchanged for privately placed debt with similar terms,
pursuant to the requirements of registration rights agreements. The
privately placed debt includes the debt issued in November of 2008,
as well as February and May of 2009. This Report on Form 10-Q does
not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.
Verizon Communications In March 2009, Verizon issued
$1.8 billion of 6.35% notes due 2019 and $1.0 billion of 7.35%
notes due 2039, resulting in cash proceeds of $2.7 billion, net of
discounts and issuance costs, which was used to reduce our
commercial paper borrowings, repay maturing debt and for general
corporate purposes. In December 2008, we entered into a $0.2
billion vendor provided credit facility and in January 2009, we
borrowed the entire amount available under this facility. During
the first half of 2009, $0.2 billion of 5.5% notes issued by
Verizon California Inc., $0.2 billion of 5.875% notes issued by
Verizon New England Inc., and $0.5 billion of floating rate notes
issued by Verizon matured and were repaid. On April 15, 2009, we
terminated all commitments under our $6.0 billion three-year credit
facility with a syndicate of lenders that was scheduled to mature
in September 2009 and entered into a new $5.3 billion 364-day
credit facility with a group of major financial institutions. As of
June 30, 2009, the unused borrowing capacity under the 364-day
credit facility was approximately $5.2 billion.
Guarantees We guarantee the debt
obligations of GTE Corporation (but not the debt of its subsidiary
or affiliate companies) that were issued and outstanding prior to
July 1, 2003. In April 2009, $0.5 billion of 7.51% notes
issued by GTE Corporation matured and were repaid. As of
June 30, 2009, $1.7 billion principal amount of these
obligations remained outstanding.
Debt Covenants

consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our debt
covenants. "

of debt maturing within twelve months and $617 million of fixed-rate
tax-exempt bonds and $39 million of fixed-rate tax-exempt project
bonds subject to remarketing within the next twelve months. We have classified
$244 million of these borrowings as current portion of long-term
debt; the remaining $813 million is classified as long-term as of
June 30, 2009 based on our intent and ability, given the capacity
available under our revolving credit facility and Canadian credit facility,
to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis. The significant
changes in our debt balances from December 31, 2008 to June 30,
2009 are related to the following: • Revolving
credit facility — We repaid the $300 million
of outstanding borrowings with proceeds from the issuance of senior notes
as discussed below. • Canadian credit facility — The
increase in the carrying value of this obligation is due to (i) accounting
for changes in the Canadian currency translation rate, which increased the
carrying value of this debt by $12 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2009, and (ii) the impact of interest accretion,
which increased the carrying value of this debt by $3 million during
the six months ended June 30, 2009. These increases were partially
offset by $10 million of debt repayments. As of June 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008, $230 million and $209 million, respectively, of these
advances were classified as long-term based on our intent and ability to refinance
the obligations on a long-term basis under the terms of the facility. • Senior notes — In
February 2009, we issued $350 million of 6.375% senior notes
due March 11, 2015 and $450 million of 7.375% senior
notes due March 11, 2019. The net proceeds from the debt issuance
were $793 million. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay $300 million
of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit
facility and the remaining proceeds were used to repay $500 million
of 6.875% senior notes that matured in May 2009. The remaining change in the carrying value of our senior notes from December 31,
2008 to June 30, 2009 is due to accounting for our fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, which
are accounted for as fair value hedges resulting in all fair value adjustments
being reflected as a component of the carrying value of the underlying debt.
For additional information regarding our interest rate derivatives, refer
to Note 11. • Tax-exempt
bonds — We issued $30 million of tax-exempt
bonds during the six months ended June 30, 2009. The proceeds from
the issuance of the bonds were deposited directly into a trust fund and may
only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised, which
is generally to finance expenditures for landfill construction and development,
equipment, vehicles and facilities in support of our operations. Accordingly,
the restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not been
included in “New Borrowings” in our Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. During the six months ended June 30, 2009,
$65 million of our tax-exempt bonds were repaid with available cash. "

1,2009-07-30,97216,XBRL," NOTE L - LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS 2006 Credit Agreement On July 14, 2006, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered
into a Credit Agreement (the 2006 Credit Agreement) with the lenders party
thereto (the Lenders) and Credit Suisse, as administrative and collateral
agent. The 2006 Credit Agreement provides the Company with a revolving line of
credit of up to $550 available through July 14, 2012 and term debt of $136.2
that will mature on July 14, 2013. The revolving line of credit consists of $350
of domestic revolving loans and $200 of multicurrency revolving loans. The 2006
Credit Agreement also provides for incremental loan commitments of up to $300,
which may be extended at the option of the Lenders or other lenders, subject to
the approval of the administrative agent, in the form of revolving credit loans,
term loans or a combination of both. The 2006 Credit Agreement was amended on
January 1, 2008, February 24, 2009 and June 3, 2009. Pursuant to the June 2009 amendment, the Company reduced its domestic
revolving credit commitments under the 2006 Credit Agreement by $150, prepaid
$58.4 principal amount of its term loans thereunder, and increased the interest
rates charged thereunder. The amendment also eliminated certain existing
financial covenants dealing with the Companys consolidated leverage ratio and
consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and instead will require the Company
to maintain liquidity of not less than $250 on the last day of each fiscal
quarter through June 30, 2011, and thereafter maintain a specified senior
secured debt leverage ratio. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company added
flexibility in various restrictive covenants and also agreed to provide certain
collateral to secure the Companys obligations under the 2006 Credit Agreement.
The amendment also included certain other technical changes. The Company recorded a charge of $3.3 to recognize a loss on the
write-off of unamortized debt acquisition costs for the June 2009 amendment and
for debt acquisition costs incurred in connection with the prepayment of
existing term loans. As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had $136.2 and
$195.0, respectively, of term loans outstanding under the 2006 Credit Agreement.
Term loans under the 2006 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus
3.75% and LIBOR plus 1.75% at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
The weighted average interest rate on the term loans under the 2006 Credit
Agreement at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was 4.35% and 3.21%,
respectively. At December 31, 2008, the Company had a balance of $35.0 outstanding
under the revolving credit component of the 2006 Credit Agreement. The Company
did not have any revolving credit amount outstanding as of June 30, 2009. The
weighted average interest rate on the outstanding portion of the 2006 Credit
Agreement revolving credit component at December 31, 2008 was
3.25%. The 2006 Credit Agreement incorporates facilities for issuance of letters
of credit up to $250. Letters of credit issued under the 2006 Credit Agreement
letter of credit facility decrease availability under the $550 revolving line of
credit. As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had letters of
credit issued under the 2006 Credit Agreement that totaled $64.1 and $82.2,
respectively. The 2006 Credit Agreement also permits the Company to have
additional letter of credit facilities up to $100, and letters of credit issued
under such additional facilities do not decrease availability under the
revolving line of credit. As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company
had letters of credit issued under the additional letter of credit facilities of
the 2006 Credit Agreement that totaled $11.0 and $13.9, respectively. The
Company also has bilateral arrangements to issue letters of credit with various
other financial institutions. These additional letters of credit do not reduce
the Companys availability under the 2006 Credit Agreement. The Company had
letters of credit issued under these additional arrangements of $48.2 and $59.2
as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. In total, as of June
30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of
$123.3 and $155.3, respectively. The 2006 Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with a number of
covenants. These covenants require the Company to meet certain financial tests,
namely (a) to maintain liquidity (as defined in the amendment) of not less than
$250 on the last day of each fiscal quarter through June 30, 2011, and (b)
thereafter, to maintain a senior secured debt leverage ratio (as defined in the
amendment) not in excess of 3.50 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter, with
the ratio declining to 3.00 to 1.00 effective October 1, 2012 and 2.50 to 1.00
effective October 1, 2013. The covenants also limit, in certain circumstances,
Terexs ability to take a variety of actions, including: incur indebtedness;
create or maintain liens on its property or assets; make investments, loans and
advances; engage in acquisitions, mergers, consolidations and asset sales; and
pay dividends and distributions, including share repurchases. At any time on or
prior to June 30, 2011, if the Companys consolidated leverage ratio is greater
than 2.50 to 1.00, the Company will be prohibited from repurchasing shares of
its Common Stock, paying dividends or redeeming debt (other than regularly
scheduled payments of debt and debt under the 2006 Credit Agreement). The 2006
Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Companys future
compliance with its financial covenants under the 2006 Credit Agreement will
depend on its ability to generate earnings and manage its assets effectively.
The 2006 Credit Agreement also has various non-financial covenants, both
requiring the Company to refrain from taking certain future actions (as
described above) and requiring the Company to take certain actions, such as
keeping in good standing its corporate existence, maintaining insurance, and
providing its bank lending group with financial information on a timely
basis. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries agreed to take certain
actions to secure borrowings under the 2006 Credit Agreement. As a result, the
Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an Amended and Restated
Guarantee and Collateral Agreement with Credit Suisse, as collateral agent for
the Lenders, granting security to the Lenders for amounts borrowed under the
2006 Credit Agreement. The Company is required to (a) pledge as collateral the
capital stock of the Companys material domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the
capital stock of certain of the Companys material foreign subsidiaries, and (b)
provide a first priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially
all of the Companys domestic assets. 10-7/8% Senior Notes On June 3, 2009, the Company sold and issued $300 aggregate principal
amount of 10-7/8% Senior Notes Due 2016 sold at 97.633% (10-7/8% Notes). The
Company used a portion of the approximately $293 proceeds from the offering of
the 10-7/8% Notes, together with a portion of the proceeds from the 4%
Convertible Notes discussed below, to prepay a portion of its term loans under
the 2006 Credit Agreement and to pay off the outstanding balance under the
revolving credit component of the 2006 Credit Agreement. The 10-7/8% Notes are
not currently guaranteed by any of the Companys subsidiaries, but under
specified limited circumstances, along with the 4% Convertible Notes and the 8%
Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2017 (8% Notes), could be guaranteed by certain
domestic subsidiaries of the Company in the future. The 10-7/8% Notes are
redeemable by the Company beginning in June 2013 at an initial redemption price
of 105.438% of principal amount. 4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes On June 3, 2009, the Company sold and issued $172.5 aggregate principal
amount of 4% Convertible Notes. In certain circumstances and during certain
periods, the 4% Convertible Notes will be convertible at an initial conversion
rate of 61.5385 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of
convertible notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
$16.25 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in some events. Upon
conversion, Terex will deliver cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the
4% Convertible Notes to be converted and shares of Common Stock with respect to
the remainder, if any, of Terexs convertible obligation in excess of the
aggregate principal amount of the 4% Convertible Notes being converted. The 4%
Convertible Notes are not currently guaranteed by any of the Companys
subsidiaries, but under specified limited circumstances, along with the 10-7/8%
Notes and 8% Senior Subordinated Notes, could be guaranteed by certain domestic
subsidiaries of the Company in the future. The provisions of FSP No. APB 14-1 are applicable to the 4% Convertible
Notes. FSP No. APB 14-1 requires the Company, as issuer of the 4% Convertible
Notes, to separately account for the liability and equity components of the 4%
Convertible Notes in a manner that reflects the Companys nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate at the date of issuance when interest cost is recognized in
subsequent periods. The Company allocated $54.3 of the $172.5 principal amount
of the 4% Convertible Notes to the equity component, which represents a discount
to the debt and will be amortized into interest expense using the effective
interest method through June 2015. The Company recorded a related deferred tax
liability of $19.4 on the equity component. The balance of the 4% Convertible
Notes was $118.7 at June 30, 2009. Accordingly, the Companys effective interest
rate on the 4% Convertible Notes will be 11.375%, so the Company will recognize
interest expense during the twelve months ended June 2010 on the 4% Convertible
Notes in an amount that approximates 11.375% of $118.2, the liability component
of the 4% Convertible Notes at the date of issuance. The Company recognized
interest expense of $1.0 on the 4% Convertible Notes for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2009. The interest expense recognized for the 4%
Convertible Notes in the twelve months ended June 2011 and subsequent periods
will increase as the discount is amortized using the effective interest method,
which accretes the debt balance over its term to $172.5 at maturity. Interest
expense on the 4% Convertible Notes throughout its term includes 4% annually of
cash interest on the maturity balance of $172.5 plus non-cash interest expense
accreted to the debt balance as described. The 4% Convertible Notes are
classified as long-term debt in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheet at June 30, 2009 based on their June 2015 maturity
date. 8% Senior Subordinated Notes On November 13, 2007, the Company sold and issued $800 aggregate
principal amount of 8% Notes. The 8% Notes are not currently guaranteed by any
of the Companys subsidiaries, but under specified limited circumstances, along
with the 10-7/8% Notes and the 4% Convertible Notes, could be guaranteed by
certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company in the future. The 8% Notes are
redeemable by the Company beginning in November 2012 at an initial redemption
price of 104.000% of principal amount. 7-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes As of June 30, 2009, the Company had $298.8 aggregate principal amount of
7-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2014 (7-3/8% Notes) outstanding. The
7-3/8% Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain domestic
subsidiaries of the Company (see Note Q - Consolidating Financial Statements).
The 7-3/8% Notes were redeemable by the Company beginning in January 2009 at an
initial redemption price of 103.688% of principal amount. The Company does not
currently plan to redeem these notes. Based on quoted market values and indicative price quotations from
financial institutions, the Company estimates that the fair values of the 7-3/8%
Notes, 8% Notes, 4% Convertible Notes (net of discount), 10-7/8% Notes and the
term debt under the 2006 Credit Agreement were approximately $276, $610, $118,
$293 and $127, respectively as of June 30, 2009. The Company believes that the
carrying value of its other borrowings approximates fair market value based on
discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar
terms and remaining maturities.

These instruments, plus $40 million of the amount shown as other, comprise the current portion of long-term debt as of September 26, 2008. The carrying amount of
Tyco's debt subject to the provisions of FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1
at June 26, 2009 was $4,155 million. The Company has determined the
fair value of such debt to be $4,279 million at June 26, 2009. The
Company utilizes various valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of
its debt which is primarily dependent on the type of market in which the
Company's debt is traded. When available, the Company uses quoted market prices
to determine the fair value of its debt which is traded in active markets. At
June 26, 2009, the fair value of the Company's debt which is actively
traded was $4,047 million. When quoted market prices are not readily
available or representative of fair value, the Company utilizes market
information of comparable debt with similar terms, such as maturities, interest
rates and credit risk to determine the fair value of its debt which is traded in
markets that are not active. At June 26, 2009, the fair value of the
Company's debt which is not actively traded was $32 million. Additionally,
the Company believes the carrying amount of its commercial paper of
$200 million approximates fair value based on the maturities of such debt
and the frequency in which the interest rates reset. In May 2008, Tyco
International Finance S.A. (""TIFSA"") commenced issuing commercial paper to
U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers.
Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general
corporate purposes. As of June 26, 2009 and September 26, 2008, TIFSA
had $200 million and $116 million, respectively, of commercial paper
outstanding bearing interest at an average rate of 0.59% and 2.95%,
respectively. At June 26, 2009 and
September 26, 2008, the Company classified $200 million and
$116 million, respectively, of short-term commercial paper as long-term.
Settlement of the amount outstanding at June 26, 2009 is not expected to
require the use of working capital in the next year, as the Company has both the
intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. On January 9, 2009,
TIFSA issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 8.5% Notes due on
January 15, 2019, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the
Company (the ""2019 Notes""). TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately
$745 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The net
proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment
of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of
common shares, capital expenditures and investments in the Company's
subsidiaries. The 2019 Notes are unsecured and rank equally with TIFSA's other
unsecured and unsubordinated debt. TIFSA may redeem any of the 2019 Notes at any
time by paying the greater of the principal amount of the notes or a
""make-whole"" amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the 2019
Notes have the right to require TIFSA to repurchase all or a portion of the
notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes
repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of
control triggering event, which requires both a change of control and a rating
event as defined by the Indenture governing the Notes. Additionally, the holders
of the 2019 Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a
portion of the 2019 Notes on July 15, 2014 at a purchase price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid
interest. Otherwise, the notes mature on January 15, 2019. The Company
incurred approximately $5 million of debt issuance costs in connection with
the transaction, which includes underwriter discounts, as well as legal,
accounting and rating agency fees. The debt issuance costs will be amortized
from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date, which is
July 15, 2014. Interest is payable semiannually on
January 15th and July 15th. The interest rate payable on the 2019
Notes is subject to escalations, as defined by the Indenture, if either Moody's
or S&P downgrades the Company's debt rating below investment grade. The 2019
Notes will not be subject to the preceding adjustments if at any time the
Company's debt rating increases one level above its current rating to A3 and A-
for Moody's and S&P, respectively. On January 15, 2009,
TIFSA made a payment of $215 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes
due 2009 which matured on the same date. Additionally, in November 2008, TIFSA
made a payment of $300 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due
2008. On June 24, 2008,
Tyco and TIFSA entered into a $500 million senior unsecured revolving
credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders
party thereto. This credit agreement has a three-year term. Borrowings under
this agreement have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR or an alternate base
rate. The margin over LIBOR can vary based on changes in the Company's credit
rating and facility utilization. Together with the existing $1.25 billion
five-year senior revolving credit agreement, dated as of April 25, 2007,
the Company's total committed revolving credit line was $1.75 billion.
These revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital, capital
expenditures and general corporate purposes. On January 29, 2009, the
Company repaid $686 million to extinguish the entire outstanding balance
under its revolving credit facilities. As of June 26, 2009, there were no
amounts drawn under these facilities. On September 15,
2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (""Lehman"") filed a petition under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York. Lehman was one of the lenders in the
Company's $1.25 billion revolving credit facility with a commitment of
$60 million. Our $500 million credit facility did not have a
commitment from Lehman. On December 26,
2008, Lehman relinquished all of its rights and obligations as a lender under
the $1.25 billion credit facility. At that time, Lehman assigned all of its
commitment under the facility to TIFSA. As a result, the aggregate available
commitment under the facility was reduced by the assigned amount. As of
June 26, 2009, the aggregate available commitment under the Company's
senior revolving credit facilities was $1.69 billion, $200 million of
which was dedicated to backstop all of the Company's commercial paper
outstanding as of such date. "

Note indentures, other than certain restrictions on mergers or consolidations. On June 2,
2009, the company commenced a tender offer for the maximum aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding 5.625% senior notes due 2012, the 5.375% senior
notes due 2013, and the 5.375% senior notes due 2014 (collectively, the “Notes”)
that it could purchase for $100.0 million at a purchase price per
$1,000 principal amount determined in accordance with the procedures of a
modified “Dutch Auction” (tender offer). The tender offer
expired at midnight on June 29, 2009, and on June 30, 2009,
$104.3 million of the Notes had been retired, generating a gross
gain of $4.3 million upon the retirement of debt at a discount ($3.3 million
net of related expenses and the write-off of remaining unamortized debt discount
costs), which was recorded in other gains and losses, net, on the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30,
2009. The fair market
value of the company’s long term debt was determined by market quotes
as well as the outcome of the tender offer. Previously, due to the absence
of an active market, the company relied upon the average price quoted by brokers
for determining the fair market value of the debt. For the 4.5% senior notes
due December 15, 2009, the company used market quotes to fair value
the notes. The level of trading, both in number and amount of notes traded,
in the 2009 maturity has increased substantially since the notes became short-term.
Therefore, the company believes the market quotes to be a reasonable representation
of the fair market value of the notes. The tender offer facilitated the determination
of the fair market value of the company’s 2012, 2013, and 2014 maturities.
The offering was structured as a modified “Dutch Auction,”
which allowed the investors to decide the price at which they believe to be
fair market value of the notes. The transaction settled on June 30,
2009, and the prices the company paid to tender the notes were used in the
determination of the fair market value of the remaining debt. Analysis

long-term debt 1,039.9 On
June 9, 2009, the company completed a new three-year $500.0 million
revolving bank credit facility. The new credit facility replaced the $900.0 million
credit facility that was scheduled to expire on March 31, 2010, but
was terminated concurrent with the entry into the new credit facility. No
early termination fees were incurred, and at the time of the termination,
there were no loans outstanding under the prior credit facility. Amounts
borrowed under the new credit facility are repayable at maturity on June 9,
2012, provided that such maturity date will automatically be accelerated to
March 16, 2012, if 90% or more of the $300.0 million face
amount of the company’s 5.625% senior notes due 2012, are not repaid,
repurchased or defeased prior to March 16, 2012. Subject to certain
conditions, the company has the right to increase the aggregate borrowings
under the new credit facility up to $750.0 million. At
June 30, 2009, there was no outstanding balance on the new credit
facility expiring June 9, 2012. Borrowings under the new credit facility
will bear interest at (i) LIBOR for specified interest periods or
(ii) a floating base rate (based upon the highest of (a) the
Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%
and (c) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%), plus,
in either case, an applicable margin determined with reference to the company’s
credit ratings and specified credit default spreads. Based on credit ratings
as of June 30, 2009, of the company and such credit default spreads,
the applicable margin for LIBOR-based loans was 1.50% and for base rate loans
was 0.50%. In addition, the company is required to pay the lenders a facility
fee on the aggregate commitments of the lenders (whether or not used) at a
rate per annum which is based on the company’s credit ratings. Based
on credit ratings as of June 30, 2009, the annual facility fee was
equal to 0.50%. The weighted average interest rate on the prior credit facility
expiring March 31, 2010, was 2.80% at June 30, 2008. The
credit agreement governing the new credit facility contains customary restrictive
covenants on the company and its subsidiaries. Restrictive covenants in the
credit agreement include, but are not limited to: prohibitions on creating,
incurring or assuming any liens; making or holding external loans; entering
into certain restrictive merger arrangements; selling, leasing, transferring
or otherwise disposing of assets; making certain investments; making a material
change in the nature of the business; making material amendments to organic
documents; making a significant accounting policy change in certain situations;
making or entering into restrictive agreements; becoming a general partner
to certain investments; entering into transactions with affiliates; incurring
certain indebtedness through the non-guarantor subsidiaries; and making certain
restricted payments (with respect to equity and debt holders). Many of these
restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. Financial
covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance
of a debt/EBITDA ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater
than 3.25:1.00 through December 31, 2010, and not greater than 3.00:1.00
thereafter, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit
agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended
before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00, and (iii) maintenance
on a monthly basis of consolidated long-term assets under management (as defined
in the credit agreement) of not less than $194.8 billion, which amount
is subject to a one-time reset by the company under certain conditions. The
credit agreement governing the new credit facility also contains customary
provisions regarding events of default which could result in an acceleration
or increase in amounts due, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds
and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material
inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings,
change of control, certain judgments, ERISA matters, cross-default to other
debt agreements, governmental action prohibiting or restricting the company
or its subsidiaries in a manner that has a material adverse effect and failure
of certain guaranty obligations. The
lenders (and their respective affiliates) may have provided, and may in the
future provide, investment banking, cash management, underwriting, lending,
commercial banking, leasing, foreign exchange, trust or other advisory services
to the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. These parties may have
received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation for these
services. "

Financings Commercial Paper
Facility We have a $1.0 billion
commercial paper program whereby notes are offered pursuant to an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and
may have a maturity of up to 364 days from the date of issue.
However, during the second half of 2008, the unfavorable liquidity
environment impacted our ability to issue commercial paper and the
downgrade of our holding company resulted in us being ineligible to
participate in the Federal Reserve’s Commercial Paper Funding
Facility (“CPFF”) which went into effect in
October 2008. The $203 million of outstanding commercial paper
as of December 31, 2008 was held by CPFF until maturity and
was fully repaid in February 2009. In the current market
environment, we do not anticipate issuing commercial
paper. Revolving Credit
Facilities We have a $1.0 billion
five-year revolving credit facility that matures in May 2012 and a
$1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in
August 2012. These facilities bear variable interest rates based on
one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus
a margin. Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (“LCP”) had
committed $70 million under the August 2012 credit facility and
Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (“Lehman FSB”) had committed
$70 million under the May 2012 credit facility. On October 5,
2008, LCP filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York. LCP was unable to fulfill its commitments
under the August 2012 credit facility and Lehman FSB declined to
fulfill its commitment under the May 2012 credit facility.
Therefore, we only have access to $1.9 billion under these
facilities. As of June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, we had borrowings of $930 million under
these facilities. As of June 30, 2009, we utilized $105
million under these facilities primarily for the issuance of
letters of credit for the benefit of one of our life insurance
subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2008, we utilized $184
million under these facilities primarily for the issuance of
letters of credit for the benefit of one of our U.S. mortgage
insurance subsidiaries. Long-Term Senior
Notes During the second quarter of
2009, we repaid principal of $329 million of our 5.23% senior notes
that matured in May 2009, plus accrued interest. During the first
quarter of 2009, we repurchased principal of $79 million of our
4.75% senior notes, plus accrued interest. During the second
quarter of 2009, we repaid the remaining principal of $331 million
of our 4.75% senior notes that matured in June 2009, plus accrued
interest. We have no additional long-term senior notes maturing
until 2011. Non-Recourse Funding
Obligations As of June 30, 2009, we
had $3.4 billion of fixed and floating rate non-recourse funding
obligations outstanding backing additional statutory reserves. Of
these obligations, $1.7 billion were guaranteed by third-party
financial guaranty insurance companies and the interest rates on
these obligations are subject to rate resets triggered by negative
rating agency actions on the third-party financial guaranty
insurance companies that guarantee these obligations. During 2008,
the rates on those $1.7 billion of non-recourse funding obligations
were contractually reset to the highest margin to the related
underlying index rates. On March 25, 2009, River
Lake Insurance Company IV Limited, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
repaid $12 million of its total outstanding $40 million Class B
Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due May 25, 2028 following an
early redemption event, in accordance with the priority of
payments. As of June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the weighted-average interest rates on our
non-recourse funding obligations were 1.48% and 3.76%,
respectively, reflecting the decline in the underlying index
rate. "

3,2009-07-31,931148,XBRL," (4) Adoption of FSP APB
14-1 As mentioned in Note 2, we
were required to retrospectively change our method of accounting
for the Debentures during the period they were outstanding to
comply with FSP APB 14-1 (the “FSP”). Initial Measurement
Accounting On January 22, 2004, GTI
issued $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of Debentures
which were scheduled to mature on January 15, 2024, unless
earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The FSP required us to
separate the proceeds from the Debentures into two accounting
components at issuance: 1.
a debt component, representing the fair value of the Debentures
as if they had no conversion rights, and 2.
an equity component, representing the difference between the
proceeds from the issuance of the Debentures and the fair value of
the debt component. The amount allocated to the
equity component was accounted for as debt discount. We also
allocated the transaction costs to the liability and equity
components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and
accounted for them as debt issuance costs and equity issuance
costs, respectively. The debt discount and debt
issuance costs not allocated to equity were amortized over the
period to the first conversion date (7 years) using the interest
method and recorded as interest expense. Because the amounts
allocated to equity were not deductible for income tax purposes, we
recorded the tax effects as adjustments to additional paid-in
capital. Redemption
Accounting On May 30, 2008, we
called for the redemption of the $225.0 million outstanding
principal amount of the Debentures. On June 13, 2008, the
redemption date, the Debenture holders who exercised their
conversion rights received 60.3136 shares of our common stock for
each $1,000 principal amount of Debentures on conversion, together
with a make-whole payment totaling $9.0 million, which represented
the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of interest
on the redeemed Debentures from the date of conversion through
January 15, 2011. We also made payment of $0.2
million to the Debenture holders who did not exercise their
conversion rights and opted to receive a redemption price in cash
equal to 100% of the principal plus accrued but unpaid interest
until the redemption date. These Debenture holders received the
make-whole value in shares. Under the FSP, we allocated
the fair value of the consideration transferred (13.6 million
shares of common stock with an aggregate value of $366.4 million)
to the fair values of the debt component ($194.7 million) and the
equity component ($171.7 million) immediately prior to the
redemption. A $4.1 million gain was recognized for the difference
between the amount allocated to the debt component and the sum of
the carrying amount of the debt, unamortized debt discount, and
issuance costs at conversion. At redemption, we recorded additional
valuation allowance of $9.9 million as a result of the reduction of
the deferred tax liability for the difference in debt discount and
debt issuance costs expense recognized for financial and tax
reporting. Effect of

DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES Committed Lines of CreditAt June 30, 2009, Sempra Energy had $4.3 billion in committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper and variable-rate demand notes, the major components of which are detailed below. Available unused credit on these lines at June 30, 2009 was $3.6 billion. We discuss the terms of our credit agreements in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.These amounts exclude lines of credit associated with Sempra Commodities, some of which we continue to guarantee, as we discuss below in ""RBS Sempra Commodities."" RBS has replaced Sempra Energy as guarantor on all uncommitted lines of credit associated with Sempra Commodities. To the e
xtent that Sempra Energy's credit support arrangements, including Sempra Commodities' committed facilities, have not been terminated or replaced, RBS has indemnified Sempra Energy for any claims or losses arising in connection with those arrangements. Sempra GlobalSempra Global has a $2.5 billion, three-year syndicated revolving credit agreement expiring in 2011. At June 30, 2009, Sempra Global had letters of credit of $34 million outstanding and no outstanding borrowings under the facility. The facility provides support for $366 million of commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2009, $200 million of the commercial paper outstanding has been classified as long-term debt based on management’s intent and ability to maintain this level of borrowing on a long-term basis either supported by this credit facility or by issuing long-term debt.Sempra GenerationSempra Generation has a $1 billion, three-year syndicated revolving credit agreement expiring in 2011. At June 30, 2009, Sempra Generation had no outstanding borrowings under the facility. Sempra UtilitiesSDG&E and SoCalGas have a combined $800 million, three-year syndicated revolving credit agreement expiring in 2011. The agreement permits each utility to individually borrow up to $600 million, subject to a combined limit of $800 million. At June 30, 2009, SDG&E and SoCalGas had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. SDG&E had $25 million of outstanding letters of credit and $237 million of variable-rate demand notes outstanding supported by this facility at June 30, 2009.WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATESAt June 30, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on the total short-term debt outstanding at Sempra Energy, including commercial paper borrowings classified as long-term, was 1.36 percent. LONG-TERM DEBTIn May 2009, Sempra Energy publicly o
ffered and sold $750 million of 6.50-percent notes, maturing in 2016.

4,063,288 $ 3,600,533 Prior
to January 1, 2009, we accounted for the embedded conversion option
in our convertible long-term debt following the recognition and measurement
principles under APB Opinion No. 14, “Accounting for Convertible
Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants” and EITF 90-19,
“Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to Settle for Cash upon Conversion.”
Under this authoritative guidance, separate accounting for the embedded conversion
option was not required when the conversion spread feature did not qualify
to be accounted for as a derivative instrument. Effective
January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB FSP APB No. 14-1, “Accounting
for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
(Including Partial Cash Settlement).” The FSP clarifies the position
that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion
(including partial cash settlement) are not addressed by paragraph 12 of APB
Opinion No. 14, “Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued
with Stock Purchase Warrants.” The FSP requires that convertible
debt instruments be accounted for with a liability component based on the
fair value of a similar nonconvertible debt instrument and an equity component
based on the excess of the initial proceeds from the convertible debt instrument
over the liability component. Such excess represents proceeds related to the
conversion option and is recorded as capital in excess of par value. The liability
is recorded at a discount, which is then amortized as additional non-cash
interest expense over the convertible debt instrument’s expected
life. Our adoption of this FSP has been applied retrospectively to all past
periods presented for all convertible debt instruments within its scope. Both
our $2.75 billion 0.94% senior exchangeable notes issued May 2006
and our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes issued
June 2003 are within the scope of this FSP. Under
the provisions of this FSP the following assumptions were made in our adoption: $700

Triggers $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable
notes In May 2008 Nabors Delaware called for
redemption of all of its $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes
due 2023. The total amount paid to effect the redemption and related exchange
was $700 million in cash and the issuance of approximately 5.25 million
of our common shares with a fair value of $249.8 million, the price
equal to the principal amount of the notes plus the excess of the exchange
value of the notes over their principal amount. $2.75 billion 0.94% senior exchangeable
notes (1) The notes are exchangeable into cash and, if applicable, Nabors
common shares based on an exchange rate of the equivalent value of 21.8221
Nabors common shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equal
to an initial exchange price of approximately $45.83 per share), subject to
adjustment during the 30 calendar days ending at the close of business on
the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. The number of shares that we would be
required to issue upon exchange consists only of the incremental shares that
would be issued above the principal amount of the notes, as we are required
to pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes exchanged. There would
be an if-converted value in excess of the principal amount of the notes only
when the price of our shares exceeds $45.83 as of the last trading day of
the quarter and the average price of our shares for the ten consecutive trading
days beginning on the third business day after the last trading day of the
quarter exceeds $45.83. (1) Nabors Delaware entered into exchangeable
note hedge transactions with respect to our common shares. The call options
are designed to cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the
net number of our common shares that would be deliverable to exchanging noteholders
in the event of an exchange of the notes. Nabors Delaware paid an aggregate
amount of approximately $583.6 million of the proceeds from the sale
of the notes to acquire the call options. Nabors also entered into separate warrant transactions at the time
of the sale of the notes whereby we sold warrants which give the holders the
right to acquire approximately 60.0 million of our common shares
at a strike price of $54.64 per share. On exercise of the warrants, we have
the option to deliver cash or our common shares equal to the difference between
the then market price and strike price. All of the warrants will be exercisable
and will expire on August 15, 2011. We received aggregate proceeds
of approximately $421.2 million from the sale of the warrants and
used $353.4 million of the proceeds to purchase 10.0 million of Nabors’
common shares. The purchased call options and sold
warrants are separate contracts entered into by Nabors and Nabors Delaware
with two financial institutions and are not part of the terms of the notes
and will not affect the holders’ rights under the notes. The purchased
call options are expected to offset the potential dilution upon exchange of
the notes in the event that the market value per share of our common shares
at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the purchased
call options, which corresponds to the initial exchange price of the notes
and is simultaneously subject to certain customary adjustments. The warrants
will effectively increase the exchange price of the notes to $54.64 per share
of our common shares, from the perspective of Nabors, representing a 55% premium
based on the last reported bid price of $35.25 per share on May 17,
2006. In accordance with EITF 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed To and Potentially Settled In a Company’s
Own Stock” and SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity,” we recorded the exchangeable note hedge and warrants in
capital in excess of par value as of the transaction date, and will not recognize
subsequent changes in fair value. The

consolidated balance sheet is as follows: December 31, 2008 As previously Effect

2008 and the six months ended June 30, 2009 we purchased $888.5 million
par value of our $2.75 billion 0.94% senior exchangeable notes in
the open market, leaving approximately $1.86 billion par value outstanding. On
January 12, 2009, Nabors Delaware completed a private placement of
$1.125 billion aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior notes due
2019 with registration rights, which are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by us. The issue of senior notes was resold by the initial purchasers
to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to certain
investors outside of the United States under Regulation S of the
Securities Act. The senior notes bear interest at a rate of 9.25% per year,
payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year,
beginning July 15, 2009. The senior notes will mature on January 15,
2019. The senior notes
are unsecured and are junior in right of payment to any of Nabors Delaware’s
future secured debt. The senior notes rank equally with any of Nabors Delaware’s
other existing and future unsubordinated debt and are senior in right of payment
to any of Nabors Delaware’s future senior subordinated debt. Our
guarantee of the senior notes is unsecured and ranks equal in right of payment
to all of our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time
outstanding. The senior notes are subject to redemption by Nabors Delaware,
in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater
of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes then outstanding
to be redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest, determined in the manner set
forth in the indenture. In the event of a change in control triggering event,
as defined in the indenture, the holders of senior notes may require Nabors
Delaware to purchase all or any part of each senior note in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date of purchase, except to the extent Nabors Delaware has exercised its
right to redeem the senior notes. Nabors Delaware is using the proceeds of
the offering of the senior notes for the repayment or repurchase of indebtedness
and general corporate purposes. On
March 30, 2009, we and Nabors Delaware filed a registration statement
on Form S-4 under the Securities Act. The registration statement related to
the exchange offer to noteholders required under the registration rights agreement
related to the $1.125 billion senior notes. On May 11, 2009
the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. The exchange
offer commenced on June 17, 2009 and expired on July 17,
2009. See Note 16 for additional information. Our
$225 million 4.875% senior notes are due in August 2009
and accordingly, are classified as a current liability. During the six months
ended June 30, 2009, we repurchased $56.6 million par value
of these senior notes in the open market for cash totaling $56.8 million. "

7,2009-07-31,217346,XBRL," Note 9: Debt 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes On May 5, 2009, we issued $600 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the “Notes”). The Notes have a maturity date of May 1, 2013 and interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. The Notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, at the holder’s option, into shares of our common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 76.1905 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.125 per share. Upon conversion, we have the right to settle the conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes with any of the three following alternatives: (1) shares of our common stock, (2) cash, or (3) a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes are convertible only under the following certain circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after June 30, 2009 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter, (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day measurement period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day in the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate, (3) if specified distributions to holders of our common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, or (4) at any time on or after February 19, 2013. As of July 4, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the Notes had been satisfied. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes totaled approximately $582 million after deducting discounts, commissions and expenses. The Notes are accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to separately account for the liability (debt) and the equity (conversion option) components of the Notes in a manner that reflects our non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, we recorded a debt discount and corresponding increase to additional paid in capital of approximately $135 million as of the date of issuance. We are amortizing the debt discount utilizing the effective interest method over the life of the Notes which increases the effective interest rate of the Notes from its coupon rate of 4.50% to 11.72%. Transaction costs of $18 million were proportionately allocated between the liability and equity components. Concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with two counterparties, including an underwriter and an affiliate of an underwriter, of the Notes, for purposes of reducing the potential dilutive effect upon the conversion of the Notes. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions is $13.125 per share of our common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the Notes) and is subject to certain customary adjustments. The convertible note hedge transactions cover 45,714,300 shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. We may settle the convertible note hedge transactions in shares, cash or a combination of cash and shares, at our option. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $140 million, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Separately and concurrently with entering into these hedge transactions, we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, an aggregate of 45,714,300 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $15.75 per share. The aggregate proceeds from the warrant transactions were $95 million, which was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. We incurred cash and non-cash interest expense of $10 million for these Notes in the second quarter of 2009. As of July 4, 2009, the unamortized discount amount was $144 million, resulting in a net carrying value of $456 million for the liability component. Credit facility On July 14, 2009, a newly formed, wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Textron entered into a credit agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States which establishes a $500 million credit facility to provide funding to finance purchases of aircraft by non-U.S. buyers from Cessna and Bell. The facility is structured to be available for financing sales to international customers who take delivery of new aircraft by December 2010. "

The current portion of long-term debt at June 26, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was comprised of amounts shown as other. On June 9, 2009,
Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (""TEGSA""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, commenced a tender offer to purchase up to $150 million principal
amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal
amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal
amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. The debt subject to the tender offer
is reflected as long-term on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet
as of June 26, 2009. Subsequent to the quarter ended June 26, 2009,
the Company completed the tender offer. See Note 21 for additional
information regarding the tender offer. In April 2007, TEGSA
entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (""Credit
Facility""). In the quarter ended March 27, 2009, $75 million of the
commitment was assigned by Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB to TEGSA, reducing the
total effective commitment to $1,425 million. At June 26, 2009 and
September 26, 2008, TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility
contains a financial ratio covenant that requires the Company to limit its ratio
of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded
period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to no more than 3.5 to 1.0. The
Credit Facility and the Company's other debt agreements contain other customary
covenants. During the first quarter
of fiscal 2009, the Company terminated interest rate swaps designated as fair
value hedges on $300 million principal amount of the 6.55% senior notes and
$200 million principal amount of the 6.00% senior notes. Prior to the
termination, the interest rate swaps were marked to fair value, resulting in
premiums of $49 million and $14 million associated with the 6.55%
senior notes and 6.00% senior notes, respectively. The premiums will be
recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the life of the respective
notes. See Notes 11 and 21 for additional information on interest rate
swaps. The fair value of the
Company's debt was approximately $2,277 million and $3,115 million at
June 26, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. "

Arrangements In May 2009, the Company entered into a new one year revolving
credit facility in the amount of 50 million euro expiring in May 2010,
which replaced a 100 million euro revolving facility expiring May 2009. On March 16,
2009, the Company issued nine million Equity Units (Units) with an aggregate
principal amount of $450 million in a public offering. The Company
received approximately $436 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Units
after underwriting discounts and other expenses. The proceeds were used to
repay short-term indebtedness incurred within the second quarter to fund working
capital requirements. Each Unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of
(a) a purchase contract which obligates the holder to purchase, and
obligates the Company to sell, no later than March 31, 2012, a variable
number of shares of the Company’s common stock for $50 and (b) a
one-twentieth, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in a subordinated
note issued by the Company due March 31, 2042 with a principal amount
of $1,000. The subordinated notes are pledged by the holders to secure their
obligations under the purchase contract, and at the time of the offering,
the estimated fair value of the purchase contract was zero. The Company will
make quarterly interest payments at the annual rate of 11.5% on the subordinated
notes, and the first interest payment was made on June 30, 2009.
Prior to March 31, 2012, the Company may defer payment of interest
on the subordinated notes for one or more consecutive interest periods provided
that each deferred interest payment may only be deferred until the earlier
of (a) the third anniversary of the interest payment date on which
the interest payment was originally scheduled to be paid or (b) March
31, 2014. The subordinated notes will be remarketed between January 1,
2012 and March 31, 2012 whereby the interest rate on the notes will
be reset and certain other terms of the notes may be modified in order to
generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the Unit holders’
obligations under the purchase contract. If the subordinated notes are not
successfully remarketed, then a put right of holders of the notes will be
automatically exercised unless such holders (a) notify the Company
of their intent to settle their obligations under the purchase contracts in
cash, and (b) deliver $50 in cash per purchase contract, by the applicable
dates specified by the purchase contracts. Following such exercise and settlement,
the Unit holders’ obligations to purchase shares of common stock
under the purchase contracts will be satisfied in full, and the Company will
deliver the shares of common stock to such holders. In connection with this
transaction, approximately $14 million of issuance costs were incurred.
Of the total issuance costs, approximately $12 million was charged
to “Capital in excess of par value” with the remainder
deferred and amortized over three years. The number of shares to be issued
under the purchase contracts is contingent and is based on, among other things,
the share price of the Company’s common stock on the stock purchase
date and anti-dilution adjustments. The minimum and maximum number of shares
to be issued under the purchase contract is approximately 43.7 million
and 50.3 million, respectively, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.
Before the issuance of common stock upon settlement of the purchase contracts,
the purchase contracts will be reflected in diluted earnings per share using
the “if-converted” method. Under this method, if dilutive,
the common stock is assumed issued and included in calculating diluted earnings
per share. The number of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted
earnings per share is based on the nine million Units issued at $50 per Unit
divided by the beginning stock price for the reporting period. In addition,
if dilutive, interest expense and amortization, net of tax, related to the
subordinated notes will be added back to the numerator in calculating diluted
earnings per share. Refer to Note 13, “Earnings Per Share,”
for the calculation of diluted earnings per share. On March 16,
2009, the Company closed an offering of $402.5 million aggregate
principal amount of 6.5% convertible senior notes due September 30,
2012. The notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common
stock at a conversion rate of 89.3855 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal
amount of notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $11.19
per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The net proceeds from the
sale of the convertible notes were approximately $392 million after
underwriting discounts and other expenses and were used to repay short-term
indebtedness incurred within the second quarter to fund working capital requirements. In February 2009,
the Company entered into a $50 million, three year, floating rate
bilateral loan agreement. The Company drew the entire amount under the loan
agreement during the course of the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Also during
the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company retired approximately $54 million
in principal amount of its $800 million fixed rate bonds that mature
in January 2011. The Company used proceeds from the $50 million
floating rate loan agreement to retire the bonds. On January 17, 2009,
the Company retired its 24 billion yen, three year, floating rate
loan agreement that matured. The Company used proceeds from commercial paper
issuances to repay amounts due under the loan agreement. "

We did not have any short-term debt at June 27, 2009 and December 27, 2008. Malaysian Facility Agreement On May 6, 2008, in connection with the plant expansion at our Malaysian manufacturing center, First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (FS Malaysia), our indirect wholly owned subsidiary entered into an export financing facility agreement (Malaysian Facility Agreement) with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) as arranger, NATIXIS Zweigniederlassung Deutschland (NZD) as facility agent and original lender, AKA Ausfuhrkredit-Gesellschaft mbH (AKA), as original lender and NATIXIS Labuan Branch (NLB) as security agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Malaysian Facility Agreement, the lenders will furnish up to €134.0 million ($188.9 million at the balance sheet close rate on June 27, 2009 of $1.41/€1.00) of credit facilities consisting of the following (in thousands): Outstanding at June 27, Malaysian Borrowings Denomination Interest Maturity 2009 Fixed-rate euro-denominated term loan EUR 4.54% 2016 $

177,836 These credit facilities are intended to be used by FS Malaysia for the purpose of (1) partially financing the purchase of certain equipment to be used at our Malaysian manufacturing center and (2) financing fees to be paid to Euler-Hermes Kreditversicherungs-AG (Euler-Hermes), the German Export Credit Agency of Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany, which will guaranty 95% of FS Malaysia’s obligations related to the Malaysian Facility Agreement (Hermes Guaranty). In addition, FS Malaysia’s obligations related to the Malaysian Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar, Inc., pursuant to a guaranty agreement described below. FS Malaysia is obligated to pay commitment fees at an annual rate of 0.375% on the unused portions of the fixed rate credit facilities and at an annual rate of 0.350% on the unused portions of the floating rate credit facilities. In addition, FS Malaysia is obligated to pay certain underwriting, management and agency fees in connection with the credit facilities. In connection with the Facility Agreement, First Solar, Inc. entered into a first demand guaranty agreement dated May 6, 2008 in favor of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Malaysian Facility Agreement. As noted above, FS Malaysia’s obligations related to the Malaysian Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar pursuant to this guaranty agreement. In connection with the Malaysian Facility Agreement, all of FS Malaysia’s obligations related to the Malaysian Facility Agreement are secured by a first party, first legal charge over the equipment financed by the credit facilities and the other documents, contracts and agreements related to that equipment. Also in connection with the Malaysian Facility Agreement, any payment claims of First Solar, Inc. against FS Malaysia are subordinated to the claims of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Malaysian Facility Agreement. The Malaysian Facility Agreement contains various financial covenants which we must comply with, such as debt to equity ratios, total leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and debt service coverage ratios. We must submit these ratios related to the financial covenants for the first time at the end of fiscal 2009. The Malaysian Facility Agreement also contains various customary non-financial covenants which FS Malaysia must comply with, including, submitting various financial reports and business forecasts to the lenders, maintaining adequate insurance, complying with applicable laws and regulations, restrictions on FS Malaysia’s ability to sell or encumber assets and make loan guarantees to third parties. We were in compliance with these covenants through June 27, 2009. Certain of our debt-financing agreements bear interest at rates based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor). Euribor is the primary interbank lending rate within the Euro zone, with maturities ranging from one week to one year. A disruption of the credit environment as currently being experienced could negatively impact interbank lending and therefore negatively impact the Euribor rate. An increase in the Euribor rate would increase our cost of borrowing.

7,2009-08-03,50863,XBRL," Note 17: Borrowings We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first half of 2009 were approximately $610 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of June 27, 2009. In 2005, we issued $1.6 billion of 2.95% junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2005 debentures) due in 2035. The 2005 debentures pay cash interest of 2.95%. However, we recognize an effective interest rate of 6.45% on the carrying value of the debt. The effective rate is based on the rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. We capitalized all interest associated with the 2005 debentures during the first half of 2009 and the first half of 2008. The 2005 debentures issued have an outstanding principal of $1.6 billion and are reflected on our consolidated condensed balance sheets as follows: June 27, Dec. 27, (In Millions) 2009 2008 Equity component carrying amount $

890 $
886 1 Remaining amortization period of approximately 26 years as of June 27, 2009 The 2005 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock. As of June 27, 2009, the conversion rate was 32.1175 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, representing an effective conversion price of approximately $31.14 per share of common stock. As of December 27, 2008, the conversion rate was 31.7162 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, representing an effective conversion price of approximately $31.53 per share of common stock. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indenture governing the 2005 debentures (the indenture), such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of 10 cents per share, but does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder who elects to convert the 2005 debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel, as described in the indenture. The 2005 debentures, which pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually, have a contingent interest component that will require us to pay interest based on certain thresholds and for certain events commencing on December 15, 2010, as outlined in the indenture. The maximum amount of contingent interest that will accrue is 0.40% per year. The fair value of the related embedded derivative was $30 million as of June 27, 2009 ($36 million as of December 27, 2008). We can settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. On or after December 15, 2012, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If certain events occur in the future, the indenture provides that each holder of the 2005 debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holder’s debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2005 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to our existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We concluded that the 2005 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion option qualifies as a derivative under SFAS No. 133. In addition, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock,” we have concluded that the embedded conversion option would be classified in stockholders’ equity if it were a freestanding instrument. As such, the embedded conversion option is not accounted for separately as a derivative. Subsequent to the second quarter of 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of 3.25% junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2009 debentures) due in 2039, which pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. The 2009 debentures pay cash interest of 3.25% annually; however, we will recognize an effective annual interest rate of 7.20% on the carrying value of the debt. The effective rate is based on the rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. The conversion rate of the 2009 debentures is 44.0917 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, representing an effective conversion price of approximately $22.68 per share of common stock. At issuance the debt component of the 2009 debentures was valued at approximately $1.0 billion and the equity component was valued at approximately $600 million, net of deferred taxes. We utilized the majority of the proceeds of the 2009 debentures to repurchase shares of our common stock. "

The issuance resulted in gross proceeds of $998.3, offset by $6.2 in debt issuance costs. We may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes and (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. If the Company experiences a change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The fair value of long-term debt excluding the deferred gain on interest rate swaps was $1,417.3 and $450.4 as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The market approach was utilized in determining the fair value of our long-term debt, specifically quoted prices in active markets (“Level 1” inputs) and other than quoted prices that are observable (“Level 2” inputs), under the SFAS 157 fair value hierarchy. /*<![CDATA[*/ <!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} /*]]>*/ "

Debt The components of debt at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are as follows: June 30, December 31, 2009 2008 Convertible subordinated debentures $ 7,696 $ 7,464 Borrowings under revolving credit facility 79,417 79,500 Term loans 24,167 — Capital lease obligations 1,837 2,230 $ 113,117 $ 89,194 In March 2009, the Company amended its $150.0 million five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) and extended its maturity to May 31, 2011. The $150.0 million Facility has been restructured as an asset-based loan consisting of a revolving credit facility of $123.0 million (the “Revolver”) and $27.0 million in Term Loans. The $123.0 million Revolver has an interest rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 4.00% in the case of Eurodollar loans or a base rate plus 3.00% in the case of Base Rate loans. The Revolver is secured by substantially all assets of the Company as well as by pledges of stock and guaranties of certain operating subsidiaries. The Revolver includes a $15.0 million sub-facility which is available to the Company’s Canadian subsidiary. The Revolver also includes a $25.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit and a $14.0 million sub-limit for swing line loans. The Company’s ability to borrow under the $123.0 million Revolver is subject to periodic borrowing base determinations. The borrowing base consists primarily of certain eligible accounts receivable and inventories. Borrowings under the Revolver are based on predetermined advance rates based on assets (generally up to 85% of billed receivables, 80% of eligible unbilled receivables and 50% of certain inventories including work-in-process). As of June 30, 2009, the Company had approximately $79.4 million outstanding under the Revolver, which is classified as long-term debt since the Revolver expires in May 2011. The $27.0 million Term Loans are comprised of a $20.0 million Term Loan and a $7.0 million Term Loan. The Term Loans require quarterly amortization payments, which commenced on June 30, 2009. The $20.0 million Term Loan amortizes in quarterly installments of approximately $1.7 million through March 31, 2011 with a payment of approximately $6.7 million due at maturity in May 2011. The $7.0 million Term Loan amortizes in quarterly installments of approximately $1.2 million over 18 months. The Term Loans have an interest rate based on LIBOR plus 4.25% in the case of Eurodollar loans or a base rate plus 3.25% in the case of Base Rate loans. The Term Loans are secured by substantially all assets of the Company as well as by pledges of stock and guaranties of certain operating subsidiaries. The Company paid approximately $2.8 million of the $27.0 million Term Loans during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had approximately $24.2 million outstanding under the Term Loans, of which approximately $11.3 million was classified as a current liability. The Facility requires compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage covenant as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to pay cash dividends, incur debt and liens, and engage in mergers and acquisitions and sales of assets, among other things. The Company was in compliance with all loan covenants as of June 30, 2009. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, the average interest rate on the Company’s Facility approximated 5.28% and 3.80%, respectively. As of June 30, 2009, the Company paid approximately $5.5 million of costs related to the amendment and extension of the Facility. These costs primarily consist of bank fees and fees paid to attorneys and other third-party professionals and are being amortized to interest expense through May 2011. The Company’s $8.3 million Notes have been reduced by debt discounts of $624 and $856 as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The Notes are classified as long-term debt as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, since the earliest that the redemption and repurchase features can occur are in October 2010. The Company adopted the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 for its Notes during the first quarter of 2009. The impact of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 is discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes other than cross default provisions. The Company also has various capital lease obligations which are included in long-term debt.

3,331 In May 2009, DCH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into Credit Agreement Supplement No. 1 (“Term Loan C”) to its Term Loan B with Bank of America N.A. (as administrative agent and lender). Pursuant to Term Loan C, DCH incurred $500 million of indebtedness, which matures on May 14, 2014. The Term Loan C indebtedness is repayable in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million (totaling 1% annually) beginning June 30, 2009 through March 31, 2014, with the balance due on the maturity date and bears interest at an initial rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.25% and a LIBOR floor of 2.00%, which was 5.25% at June 30, 2009. Approximately $162 million and $315 million of the net proceeds from Term Loan C were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan A and the Revolving Loan, respectively. The Company capitalized approximately $10 million of deferred financing costs as a result of this transaction. From May 14, 2009 through June 30, 2009, the weighted average effective interest rate for Term Loan C was 6.03%. Discovery’s $1.5 billion Term Loan B and $500 million Term Loan C are each secured by the assets of DCH, excluding assets held by DCH’s subsidiaries. The remaining Term Loan A, Revolving Loans and Senior Notes are unsecured.

The Term Loans, Revolving Loan, and Senior Notes contain covenants that require the Company to meet certain financial ratios and place restrictions on the payment of dividends, sale of assets, borrowing level, mergers, and purchases of capital stock, assets, and investments. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Fair Value of Debt The fair value of the Company’s borrowings was $3.4 billion at both June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, which was estimated based on current market rates and credit pricing for similar debt types and maturities.

2,733,543 As of July 3, 2009 and March 31, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Company’s $2.0 billion credit facility. As of July 3, 2009, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under this credit facility. During June 2009, the Company paid approximately $203.2 million to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $99.8 million of its outstanding 6 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the “6 1/2% Notes”) and an aggregate principal amount of $99.9 million of its outstanding 6 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the “6 1/4% Notes” and collectively referred to as the “Notes”) in a cash tender offer (the “Offer”). The cash paid includes $8.8 million in consent fees (as discussed further below) paid to holders of the Notes that were tendered but not purchased as well as to holders that consented but did not tender, which were capitalized and will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes. The Company recognized an immaterial gain during the three-month period ended July 3, 2009 associated with the partial extinguishment of the Notes net of approximately $5.3 million for estimated transaction costs and the write-down of related debt issuance costs, which is included in Other charges, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of July 3, 2009, $299.8 million of the 6 1/2% Notes and $302.2 million of the 6 1/4% Notes remained outstanding. In conjunction with the Offer, the Company obtained consents from the holders of Notes tendered but not purchased as well as to holders that consented but did not tender to certain amendments to the restricted payments covenants and certain related definitions in each of the indentures (the “Indentures”) under which the Notes were issued. The amendments permit the Company greater flexibility to purchase or make other payments in respect of its equity securities and debt that is subordinated to the Notes and to make certain other restricted payments under each Indenture. Subsequent to July 3, 2009, the Company paid $195.0 million to redeem the 0% Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes upon their maturity. These notes carried conversion provisions to issue shares to settle any conversion spread (excess of conversion price over the face amount of $10.50 per share). On the maturity date the Company’s stock price was less than the face amount, and therefore no shares were issued. Adoption of FSP APB 14-1 On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP APB 14-1, which was required to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of FSP APB 14-1 affected the accounting for the Company’s 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes and Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes (collectively referred to as the “Convertible Notes”) by requiring the initial proceeds from their sale to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that results in interest expense on the debt component at the Company’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the date of issuance. Upon adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the Company recorded the change in accounting principle from adopting FSP APB 14-1 retrospectively to all periods presented, which included cumulative effect adjustments as of March 31, 2009 to the opening balance of Accumulated deficit of approximately $225.0 million, an approximate $27.6 million reduction in the carrying value of the Convertible Notes, an increase in the recorded value of Ordinary shares of approximately $252.0 million, which represents the carrying amount of the equity component, and a reduction to deferred financing costs of approximately $525,000, which is included in Other assets. The adjustment to Accumulated deficit represented imputed interest for the period from issuance of each convertible note to March 31, 2009, and a $5.8 million reduction in the gain recognized during the three-month period ended December 31, 2008 for the partial extinguishment of the 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Coupon interest expense and discount amortization related to the original issuance costs was immaterial for all periods presented. The estimated fair value of the initial debt components of the Company’s 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes and Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes were $310.9 million and $111.3 million, respectively, based on the present value of the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate comparable market nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance. The Company is amortizing the discounts using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense. The amortization of the discount results in effective interest rates of 8.21% for the 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 9.23% for the Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes. The adoption of FSP APB 14-1 had no impact on the Company’s consolidated cash flows. Below is a summary of the financial statement effects of implementing FSP APB 14-1 on the affected notes and interest expense.

Fair Values As of July 3, 2009, the approximate fair values of the Company’s 6.5% Senior Subordinated Notes, 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes, 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes and debt outstanding under its Term Loan Agreement were 96.5%, 93.25%, 94.0% and 84.15% of the face values of the debt obligations, respectively, based on broker trading prices. Due to the short remaining maturity, the carrying amount of the Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes approximates fair value. Interest Expense During the three-month periods ended July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008, the Company recognized interest expense of $46.2 million and $69.3 million (including $11.1 million for the retrospective application of FSP APB 14-1), respectively, on its debt obligations outstanding during the period.

7,2009-08-03,108772,XBRL," Note 8 – Debt In May 2009, we issued $750 of 8.25% senior notes due 2014 (the “2014 Senior Notes”) at 99.982 percent of par resulting in net proceeds of approximately $745. The 2014 Senior Notes accrue interest at the rate of 8.25% per annum, payable semi-annually and, as a result of the discount, have a weighted average effective interest rate of 8.25%. Debt issuance cost
s of approximately $5 were deferred. The 2014 Senior Notes rank equally with our other existing senior unsecured indebtedness. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. In April 2009, we amended our $2 billion Credit Facility with affiliates of Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and a group of lenders. The amendment increased the permitted leverage ratio (principal debt/consolidated EBITDA) to 4.25x through June 30, 2010. The permitted leverage ratio after June 30, 2010 then resets to 3.75x until maturity. The amendment includ
ed a re-pricing of the Credit Facility such that borrowings will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread (including fees) that varies between 2.50% and 4.50%, subject to our credit rating at the time of borrowing. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable all in spread would be 3.50%. "

Line of Credit and Bridge and Term Loans The Companys revolving
line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks provides for an aggregate
borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion and matures on August 1, 2011. This
revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to
LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.325% to 1.00%, depending upon the Companys
debt ratings. The Company pays a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment
ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, depending upon its debt ratings. Based on the
Companys debt ratings at June 30, 2009, the
margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 0.55% and the facility fee
was 0.15%. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $100 million outstanding under this revolving line of credit facility
with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 1.31%. At June 30, 2009, the
outstanding balance of the Companys term loan was $200 million and matures on
August 1, 2011. The term loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to
LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.825% to 2.375%, depending upon the Companys
debt ratings (weighted-average
effective interest rate of 2.78% at June 30, 2009). Based on the Companys debt ratings at
June 30, 2009, the margin on the term loan was 2.00%. The Companys revolving
line of credit facility and term loan contain certain financial restrictions and
other customary requirements, including cross-default provisions to other
indebtedness. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the
agreement (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to
Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Unsecured
Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, (iii) require a Fixed
Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75 times, and (iv) require a
formula-determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $4.5 billion at June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2009, the Company
was in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the
revolving line of credit facility and term loan. On May 8, 2009, the
Company repaid the remaining $320 million outstanding balance under its bridge
loan credit facility with proceeds received from the issuance of shares of
common stock. Senior
Unsecured Notes At June 30, 2009, the
Company had $3.5 billion in
aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates
on the notes ranged from 1.53% to 7.07%. The weighted-average effective interest
rate on the senior unsecured notes at June 30, 2009 was 6.13%. Discounts and premiums are amortized to
interest expense over the term of the related debt. The senior unsecured notes
contain certain covenants including limitations on debt, cross-acceleration
provisions and other customary terms. At June 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants. Mortgage Debt At June 30, 2009, the
Company had $1.6 billion in mortgage debt secured by 186 healthcare
facilities with a carrying amount of $2.8 billion. Interest rates on the
mortgage notes ranged from 0.36% to 8.63% with a weighted average effective rate
of 5.97% at June 30, 2009. Mortgage debt generally
requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by certain
properties and is generally non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts
transfer of the encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts
prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the
properties in good condition, requires maintenance of insurance on the
properties and includes requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and
terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also
cross-collateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators
to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of
such properties. Other
Debt At June 30, 2009, the
Company had $99 million of non-interest bearing life care bonds
at two of its CCRCs and non-interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another
of its senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents
of the facilities (collectively, Life Care Bonds). At June 30, 2009, $45 million of the
Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or
to their estate upon death, and $54 million of the Life Care Bonds were
refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new
resident. Debt

The debt offering yielded approximately $493.5 million of proceeds, which were used to repay at maturity our 6.15% notes due January 15, 2008 and for general corporate purposes. We issued an aggregate of $800 million principal amount of our 6.15% notes, 6.70% debentures and 5.20% debentures in January 1998. The debt offering yielded approximately $750.0 million of proceeds. We issued the 5.20% debentures at a discount, and the 6.15% notes and 6.70% debentures at par. On March 16, 2009, we replaced our former five-year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with two new unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $535.0 million. The new facilities have borrowing limits of $267.5 million each. One facility has a three-year term and the other facility has a 364-day term. Our 364-day credit facility includes a term-out option that allows us to borrow, on March 15, 2010, up to $267.5 million as a term loan for one year. We have not drawn down under any of these credit facilities at June 30, 2009 or September 30, 2008. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008. In addition to our two $267.5 million credit facilities, short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $164.2 million at June 30, 2009 were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries. There were no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities. Borrowings under our credit facilities during the three- and nine-months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were not significant. Our short-term debt obligations consist primarily of commercial paper borrowings. At June 30, 2009, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were $100.0 million at September 30, 2008. The weighted average interest rate and maturity period of the commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2008 were 2.25 percent and six days, respectively. "

At June 26, 2009, available borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $964 million after reductions for outstanding letters of credit of $36 million. (2) The interest rate at June 26, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was 1.19% and 2.70%, respectively, and is based on the LIBOR rate (as defined) plus a spread. See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for additional information regarding the interest on borrowings under the term loan facility. The term loan facility matures on March 9, 2010 and is classified as a current liability. (3) Under select conditions, including if L-3 Holdings common stock price is more than 120% (currently $120.17) of the then current conversion price ($100.14 as of July 29, 2009) for a specified period, the conversion feature of the CODES will require L-3 Holdings, upon conversion, to pay the $700 million principal amount in cash, and if the settlement amount exceeds the principal amount, the excess will be settled in cash or stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s option. At the June 26, 2009 conversion price of $101.13, the aggregate consideration to be delivered upon conversion would be determined based on 6.9 million shares of L-3 Holdings’ common stock. See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the CODES, including conditions for conversion.

At June 26, 2009, available borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $964 million after reductions for outstanding letters of credit of $36 million. (2) The interest rate at June 26, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was 1.19% and 2.70%, respectively, and is based on the LIBOR rate (as defined) plus a spread. See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for additional information regarding the interest on borrowings under the term loan facility. The term loan facility matures on March 9, 2010 and is classified as a current liability. (3) Under select conditions, including if L-3 Holdings common stock price is more than 120% (currently $120.17) of the then current conversion price ($100.14 as of July 29, 2009) for a specified period, the conversion feature of the CODES will require L-3 Holdings, upon conversion, to pay the $700 million principal amount in cash, and if the settlement amount exceeds the principal amount, the excess will be settled in cash or stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s option. At the June 26, 2009 conversion price of $101.13, the aggregate consideration to be delivered upon conversion would be determined based on 6.9 million shares of L-3 Holdings’ common stock. See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the CODES, including conditions for conversion. L-3’s stock price on July 31, 2009 was $75.50 per share. The effective interest rate on the CODES is 6.33%. Interest expense relates to both the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the discount on the liability component.

In addition, in May 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.60% Notes due 2015, $1.0 billion of 6.00% Notes due 2020 and $500 million of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances and for general corporate purposes. During the first six months of 2009, we used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to redeem $284 million of 6.375% Notes and $950 million of Floating Rate Notes upon their maturity. At June 30, 2009, we had a $7.35 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in September 2012. The facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for the ConocoPhillips $5.6 billion commercial paper program, as support for the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for up to $250 million of commercial paper issued by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline LP, a Keystone Pipeline joint venture entity. At both June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued. Under both ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $2,211 million of commercial paper was outstanding at June 30, 2009, compared with $6,933 million at December 31, 2008. Since we had $2,211 million of commercial paper outstanding, had issued $40 million of letters of credit and had up to a $250 million guarantee on commercial paper issued by Keystone, we had access to $4.8 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at June 30, 2009. Also at June 30, 2009, we classified $2,278 million of short-term debt as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facility. In July 2009, we arranged a new $500 million credit facility, which expires in July 2012, bringing our total borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities to $7.85 billion. /*<![CDATA[*/ <!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:none; font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; layout-grid-mode:line;} p.MsoHeader, li.MsoHeader, div.MsoHeader {margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:none; tab-stops:center 3.0in right 6.0in; font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; layout-grid-mode:line;} p.MsoBodyText, li.MsoBodyText, div.MsoBodyText {margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Courier New""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} /*]]>*/ "

Note 7 On March 10, 2009, the
Company issued $1.0 billion of 6.60% unsecured senior notes due
March 15, 2019 (the “2009 Notes”). The 2009 Notes
pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole or in
part, at a defined redemption price plus accrued interest. The net
proceeds were used to repay the bridge credit facility, a portion
of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings and
for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2009, the
Company’s financial instruments included cash and cash
equivalents. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, the
Company’s carrying value approximates fair value. The
carrying amount and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $7.2
billion and $7.0 billion, respectively as of June 30, 2009.
The carrying amount and estimated fair value of long-term debt was
$7.9 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively as of December 31,
2008. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated based on rates
currently offered to the Company for debt with similar terms and
maturities. On July 1, 2009, the Company
issued a $300 million unsecured floating rate senior note due
January 30, 2011 (the “the 2009 Floating Rate
Note”). The 2009 Floating Rate Note pays interest quarterly.
The net proceeds from the 2009 Floating Rate Note will be used for
general corporate purposes. "

is comprised of the following (in thousands): June 28, December 28, 2009 2008 Revolving line of credit $ 103,000 $ 123,500 Debt associated with VIEs * 4,475 7,075 Other 67 79 Total debt 107,542 130,654 Less: current portion of debt (4,475 ) (7,075 ) Long-term debt $ 103,067 $ 123,579 *Papa Johns is the guarantor of BIBPs
outstanding debt. In January 2006, we executed a five-year,
unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) totaling $175.0 million.
Under the Credit Facility, outstanding balances accrue interest at 50.0 to 100.0
basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other
bank-developed rates, at our option. The commitment fee on the unused
balance ranges from 12.5 to 20.0 basis points. The increment over LIBOR and the
commitment fee are determined quarterly based upon the ratio of total
indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA), as defined. The remaining availability under our line of credit,
reduced for certain outstanding letters of credit, approximated $54.0 million
and $31.1 million as of June 28, 2009 and December 28, 2008,
respectively. The fair value of our outstanding debt approximates the carrying
value since our debt agreements are variable-rate instruments. The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative
and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring the maintenance
of specified fixed charges and leverage ratios. At June 28, 2009 and
December 28, 2008, we were in compliance with these covenants. We
presently have two interest rate swap agreements (swaps) that provide fixed
interest rates, as compared to LIBOR, as follows: FloatingRate Debt FixedRates The first interest rate swap agreement: January 16, 2007 to January 15, 2009 $ 60 million 4.98 % January 15, 2009 to January 15, 2011 $ 50 million 4.98 % The second interest rate swap agreement: January 31, 2009 to January 31, 2011 $ 50 million 3.74 % Our swaps are derivative instruments that are
designated as cash flow hedges because the swaps provide a hedge against the
effects of rising interest rates on present and/or forecasted future borrowings.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the swaps is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the
same period or periods during which the swaps affect earnings. Gains or losses
on the swaps representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current
earnings. Amounts payable or receivable under the swaps are accounted for as
adjustments to interest expense. The

the accompanying consolidated financial statements (in thousands): Fair

Represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at
June 30, 2009 for all borrowings outstanding pursuant to each
debt instrument including the applicable margin. The interest rates
presented represent stated rates and do not include the impact of
our interest rate derivative agreements, deferred financing costs,
discounts or commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost
of borrowing. For information concerning our derivative
instruments, see note 5. (b)
Unused borrowing capacity represents the maximum availability
under the applicable facility at June 30, 2009 without regard
to covenant compliance calculations. At June 30, 2009, our
availability under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility was
limited to €241.1 million ($338.8 million).
Additionally, when the June 30, 2009 bank reporting
requirements have been completed, we anticipate that our
availability under (i) the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
will be limited to €196.7 million ($276.4 million) and
(ii) the Chellomedia Bank Facility will be limited to
€21.5 million ($30.2 million). To the extent we
were to draw on the VTR Bank Facility (as defined below)
commitments, we would be required to set aside an equivalent amount
of cash collateral. (c)
The fair values of our debt instruments were determined using
discounted cash flow models. The discount rates used in these
models are based on the estimated credit spread of each entity,
taking into account market data, to the extent available, and other
relevant factors. (d)
Amounts are net of discounts, where applicable. (e)
The UGC Convertible Notes are measured at fair value. Our
assessment of the fair value of the UGC Convertible Notes included
an estimated credit risk component of $107.5 million at
June 30, 2009. This credit risk component is estimated as the
difference between (i) the fair value of the UGC Convertible
Notes and (ii) the value of the UGC Convertible Notes derived
by holding all other inputs constant and replacing the market
credit spread with a credit spread of nil. The estimated change in
UGC’s credit risk during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2009 resulted in a gain (loss) of $5.1 million and
($3.5 million), respectively, that are included in realized and
unrealized gains due to changes in fair values of certain
investments and debt, net, in our condensed consolidated statements
of operations. For information regarding our fair value
measurements, see note 6. (f)
Pursuant to the deposit arrangements with the lender in
relation to VTR’s amended and restated senior secured credit
facility (the VTR Bank Facility), we are required to fund a cash
collateral account in an amount equal to the outstanding principal
and interest under the VTR Bank Facility. This cash collateral
account had a balance of $465.5 million at June 30, 2009, of
which $4.7 million is reflected as a current asset and $460.8
million is presented as a long-term asset in our condensed
consolidated balance sheet. UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility The UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility, as amended, is the senior secured credit facility of
UPC Broadband Holding. In March 2009, two additional facility
accession agreements (Facilities Q and R) were entered into under
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. Facility Q is a redrawable
term loan facility with an initial principal amount of
€267.0 million ($375.2 million). Facility R is a
non-redrawable term loan facility with an initial principal amount
of €236.0 million ($331.6 million). Both Facility Q and
Facility R closed on March 25, 2009, whereby certain of the
lenders under the €830.0 million ($1,166.2 million)
Facility L, which was fully drawn at such date, novated, in whole
or in part, their drawn commitments (in the aggregate amount of
€503.0 million ($706.8 million)) to Liberty Global
Europe BV (LGE), a direct subsidiary of UPC Broadband Holding, and
entered into either the new Facility Q or new Facility R. On
April 27, 2009, UPC Broadband Holding entered into two new
facility accession agreements to increase the sizes of Facilities Q
and R by €70.0 million ($98.4 million) and
€27.3 million ($38.4 million), respectively. In
connection with these new accession agreements, certain lenders
under Facility L novated, in whole or in part, their drawn
commitments in the amount of €97.3 million ($136.7
million) to LGE and entered into either Facility Q or Facility
R. On May 6, 2009, two
additional facility accession agreements (Facilities S and T) were
entered into under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. UPC
Broadband Holding and the existing Facility M and Facility N
lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility agreed to
roll (i) €1.67 billion ($2.35 billion) of the existing
Facility M commitments into Facility S, a non-redrawable term loan
facility denominated in euros and (ii) $500.0 million of
the existing Facility N commitments into Facility T, a
non-redrawable term loan facility denominated
in U.S.
dollars. Following the execution of the Facility S accession
agreement and the Facility T accession agreement, the Facility M
and Facility N lenders that decided to roll their commitments (the
Rolling Lenders) novated their existing Facility M and Facility N
commitments to LGE and entered into either the new Facility S or
Facility T. LGE was the initial lender under Facility S and
Facility T and novated its Facility S and Facility T commitments to
the Rolling Lenders. On May 22, 2009, Facility S was
increased by €30.0 million ($42.2 million) (Facility S2)
pursuant to an additional facility accession agreement. Following
the execution of the Facility S2 accession agreement, the Facility
M lender that decided to roll its commitment (the Rolling S2
Lender) novated its existing Facility M commitment to LGE and
entered into the new Facility S2. LGE was the initial lender
under Facility S2 and novated its Facility S2 commitment to the
Rolling S2 Lender. On June 3, 2009, an
additional facility accession agreement (Facility U) was entered
into under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. UPC Broadband
Holding and the existing Facility M lenders under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility agreed to roll €1,235.8 million
($1,736.4 million) of the existing Facility M commitments into
Facility U, a non-redrawable term loan facility denominated in
euros. Following the execution of the Facility U accession
agreement, the Facility M lenders that agreed to roll their
commitments (the Rolling M Lenders) novated their existing Facility
M commitments to LGE and entered into the new Facility U. LGE was
the initial lender under Facility U and novated its Facility U
commitments to the Rolling M Lenders. The process of novating
Facility M commitments to the new Facility U was completed in July
2009, with all but €16.4 million ($23.0 million) of the
novations completed by June 30, 2009. Fees and third-party costs
incurred during the first six months of 2009 in connection with the
partial refinancings of Facilities L, M and N included $32.6
million related to the completion of Facilities Q and R and $20.1
million related to the completion of Facilities S, T and U. In
accordance with applicable guidance, the fees and third-party costs
related to Facilities Q and R were capitalized as deferred
financing costs and the fees and third-party costs related to
Facilities S, T and U were charged to expense and included in
losses on debt modifications in our condensed consolidated

issue discount of 16.5%, resulting in cash proceeds before

9.875% Senior Notes are substantially identical (other than as to

April 15, 2014 in the case of the 9.875% Senior Notes, UPC
Holding may redeem some or all of such Senior Notes by paying a

Facility In June 2009, Telenet Bidco
amended its existing senior credit facility agreement (the Telenet
Credit Facility), whereby the undrawn €225.0 million
($316.1 million) term loan B2 facility (the Initial B2 Facility),
which was available to be drawn up to
June 30, 2009, was divided into two separate facilities:
(i) a €135.0 million ($189.7 million) term loan
facility (the B2A Facility), which is available to be drawn up to
and including June 30, 2010, and (ii) a
€90.0 million ($126.5 million) term loan facility (the
B2B Facility), which was available to be drawn up to and including
June 30, 2009. The B2B Facility was drawn in full on
June 29, 2009. The applicable terms and conditions of the B2A
Facility and the B2B Facility are the same as the Initial B2
Facility, with an applicable margin of 2.50% over
EURIBOR. Other J:COM
Debt In March 2009, J:COM entered
into (i) a ¥15.0 billion ($155.7 million) variable-rate
term loan agreement, of which ¥5.0 billion ($51.9 million) is
due in March 2012 and ¥10.0 billion ($103.8 million) is due in
March 2015, (ii) a ¥10.0 billion variable-interest rate
term loan agreement due in March 2014, (iii) a ¥4.0
billion ($41.5 million) variable-interest rate term loan agreement
due in March 2014 and (iv) a ¥1.0 billion ($10.4 million)
fixed-interest rate term loan agreement due in March 2016. All
amounts under these agreements were fully drawn in March 2009 and
proceeds were used to repay borrowings outstanding on certain other
J:COM revolving credit facilities. The interest rate on the
new variable-interest rate loans are based on three-month TIBOR
plus a margin ranging from 0.43% to 0.65%. The new ¥1.0
billion fixed-interest loan bears interest at 1.85%. These new
loan agreements contain covenants similar to those of J:COM’s
existing credit facilities. UGC Convertible
Notes In March 2009, we repurchased
€101.0 million ($136.9 million at the transaction dates)
principal amount of the UGC Convertible Notes at a purchase price
equal to 65% of face value, for a total of €66.4 million
($90.1 million at the transaction dates), including accrued
interest thereon. The $25.9 million change in the fair value of the
repurchased UGC Convertible Notes from December 31, 2008
through the repurchase dates is included in realized and unrealized

Long-term and Short-term Debt The following represent significant changes in debt from the amounts reported in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2008 Annual Report. Senior Notes On May 29, 2009, the Holding Company issued $1,250 million senior notes due June 1, 2016. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75%, payable semiannually. In connection with the offering, the Holding Company incurred $6 million of issuance costs which have been capitalized and included in other assets. These costs are being amortized over the term of the notes. On March 26, 2009, the Holding Company issued $397 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due June 29, 2012 under the FDIC Program. The notes bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR, reset quarterly, plus 0.32%. The notes are not redeemable prior to their maturity. In connection with the offering, the Holding Company incurred $15 million of issuance costs which have been capitalized and included in other assets. These costs are being amortized over the term of the notes. On February 17, 2009, the Holding Company closed the successful remarketing of the $1,035 million Series B portion of the junior subordinated debt securities constituting part of its common equity units issued in June 2005. The common equity units consisted of a debt security and a stock purchase contract under which the holders of the units would be required to purchase common stock. The remarketing of the Series A portion of the junior subordinated debt securities and the associated stock purchase contract settlement occurred in August 2008. In the February 2009 remarketing, the Series B junior subordinated debt securities were modified, as permitted by their terms, to be 7.717% senior debt securities Series B, due February 15, 2019. The Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their junior subordinated debt securities remarketed and used the remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under the stock purchase contracts. For those common equity unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment obligations under the stock purchase contracts, the terms of the debt they received are the same as the terms of the remarketed debt. The subsequent settlement of the stock purchase contracts provided proceeds to the Holding Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of the Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company delivered 24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common stock to settle the stock purchase contracts on February 17, 2009. Repurchase Agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York MetLife Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds $187 million and $89 million of common stock of the FHLB of NY at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, which is included in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also entered into repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby MetLife Bank has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket lien on certain of MetLife Bank’s residential mortgages, mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to collateralize MetLife Bank’s obligations under the repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank maintains control over these pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The repurchase agreements and the related security agreement represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of default by MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is limited to the amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the outstanding repurchase agreements. The amount of MetLife Bank’s liability for repurchase agreements entered into with the FHLB of NY was $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, which is included in long-term debt and short-term debt depending upon the original tenor of the advance. During the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, MetLife Bank received advances related to long-term borrowings totaling $550 million and $170 million, respectively, from the FHLB of NY. MetLife Bank made repayments to the FHLB of NY of $120 million and $171 million related to long-term borrowings for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The advances on the repurchase agreements related to both long-term and short-term debt are collateralized by residential mortgages, mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of $5.0 billion and $3.1 billion at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Collateralized Borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York MetLife Bank is a depository institution that is approved to use the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Discount Window borrowing privileges and participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Term Auction Facility. In order to utilize these facilities, MetLife Bank has pledged qualifying loans and investment securities to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as collateral. At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, MetLife Bank’s liability for advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under these facilities was $1.8 billion and $950 million, respectively, which is included in short-term debt. The estimated fair value of loan and investment security collateral pledged by MetLife Bank to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $3.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on these advances was 0.13%. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, the average daily balance of these advances was $1.6 billion and these advances were outstanding for an average of 32 days. The Company did not participate in these programs during the six months ended June 30, 2008. Short-term Debt Short-term debt was $4.8 billion and $2.7 billion at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At June 30, 2009, short-term debt consisted of $580 million of commercial paper, $1.8 billion related to the aforementioned collateralized borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and $2.4 billion related to MetLife Bank’s liability under the aforementioned repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY with original maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2008, short-term debt consisted of $714 million of commercial paper, $950 million related to the aforementioned collateralized borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, $695 million related to MetLife Bank’s liability under the aforementioned repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY with original maturities of less than one year and $300 million related to MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut’s liability for borrowings from the FHLB of Boston with original maturities of less than one year. During the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, the weighted average interest rate on short-term debt was 0.5% and 3.0%, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, the average daily balance of short-term debt was $3.4 billion and $878 million, respectively, and short-term debt was outstanding for an average of 16 days and 31 days, respectively. Credit and Committed Facilities and Letters of Credit Credit Facilities. The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities aggregating $3.2 billion at June 30, 2009.

The term loan due in December 2009 (“Term Loan”)
was paid and financed with the issuance of the 6.500% notes due
2014 (“2014 Notes”) on February 26,
2009. (b)
At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company
held interest rate swaps related to the 5.400% notes due 2011
(“2011 Notes”) with an aggregate notional amount of
$750 million and $550 million, respectively. During 2008, the
Company terminated an aggregate notional amount of $195 million of
interest rate swaps. The Company received cash, excluding interest,
of $10.7 million on the termination of these swaps, the offset of
which is reflected in “Borrowings” and will be
reclassified as a reduction to “Interest expense” over
the life of the 2011 Notes. (c)
The 2014 Notes were issued on February 26, 2009 and the
proceeds were used to redeem the Term Loan. (d)
At December 31, 2008, the Company held an interest rate
swap related to the 5.930% notes due 2016 (“2016
Notes”) with an aggregate notional amount of $110 million.
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company terminated the swap.
The Company received cash, excluding interest, of $14.6 million on
the termination of this swap, the offset of which is reflected in
“Borrowings” and will be reclassified as a reduction to
“Interest expense” over the life of the 2016 Notes. For
further information regarding the interest rate swap, refer to Note
12, “Derivatives.” (e)
At December 31, 2008, the fair value of commercial paper
approximated its carrying value due to the short term nature of the
obligations. The fair value of the Term Loan approximated its
carrying value as it was a variable rate loan and Western Union
credit spreads did not move significantly between the date of the
borrowing (December 5, 2008) and December 31, 2008. The fair
value of the fixed rate notes is determined by obtaining quotes
from multiple independent banks and excludes the impact of
discounts and related interest rate swaps. Exclusive of discounts and
the fair value of the interest rate swaps, maturities of borrowings
as of June 30, 2009 are $1.0 billion in 2011, $500 million in
2014 and $1.5 billion thereafter. The Company’s
obligations with respect to its outstanding borrowings as described
above rank equally.
2014 Notes On February 26, 2009,
the Company issued $500 million of aggregate principal amount of
2014 Notes to repay the balance of the Term Loan which was
scheduled to mature in December 2009. Interest with respect to the
2014 Notes is payable semiannually on February 26 and
August 26 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate
of 6.500%. The 2014 Notes contain covenants that, among other
things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and certain of
its subsidiaries to grant certain types of security interests or
enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The Company may redeem
the 2014 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par
or the applicable make whole premium. "

(10)Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt (a) Short-term Borrowings Receivables Facility. On November 25, 2008, CERC replaced a receivables facility that had terminated on October 28, 2008 with a new 364-day receivables facility. Availability under the new facility ranges from $128 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changesin receivables balances. At December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2009 the facility size was $128 million and $265 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2009, advances under the receivables facilities were $78 million and $75 million, respectively. Inventory Financing. In December 2008, CERC entered into an asset management agreement whereby it sold $110 million of its natural gas in storage and agreed to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas during the 2008-2009 winter heating season for payments totaling $114 million. This
transaction was accounted for as a financing and, as of December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2009, CenterPoint Energy’s financial statements reflect natural gas inventory of $75 million and $-0-, respectively, and a financing obligation of $75 million and $-0-, respectively, related to this transaction.
Revolving Credit Facility. CenterPoint Houston’s $600 million 364-day credit facility is secured by a pledge of $600 million of general mortgage bonds issued by CenterPoint Houston. Borrowing costs for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based loans under such facilitywill be at a margin of 2.25 percent above LIBOR rates, based on CenterPoint Houston’s current ratings. In addition, CenterPoint Houston will pay lenders, based on current ratings, a per annum commitment fee of 0.5 percent for their commitments under the facility and a quarterly duration fee of 0.75 percent on the average amount of outstanding borrow
ings during the quarter. The spread to LIBOR and the commitment fee fluctuate based on CenterPoint Houston’s credit rating. The facility contains covenants,including a debt (excluding transition and other securitization bonds) to total capitalization covenant. Bank fees associated with the establishment of this credit facility aggregated approximately $13 million. From inception through June 30, 2009, there have been no borrowings under the credit facility.
In April 2009, the Texas Legislature enacted legislation that authorizes the Texas Utility Commission to conduct proceedings to determine the amount of system restoration costs associated with hurricanes or other major storms that utilities are entitled to recover. The legislation authorizes the Texas Utility Commissionto issue a financing order that would permit a utility like CenterPoint Houston to recover the distribution portion of those costs through the issuance of non-recourse system restoration bonds similar to the securitization bonds issued previously. CenterPoint Houston filed an application for a financing order in July 2009 and expects to issue such bonds during 2009. CenterPoint Houston
’s $600 million credit facility will terminate prior to its November 24, 2009 scheduled expiration date if bondsare issued to securitize costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike. (b) Long-term Debt General Mortgage Bonds. In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds, due in March 2014 with an interest rate of 7.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate purposes,
including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Ike.
Revolving Credit Facilities. CenterPoint Energy’s $1.2 billion credit facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR plus 55 basis points based on CenterPoint Energy’s current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and other securitization bonds) to earningsbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant, which was modified (i) in August 2008 so that the permitted ratio of debt to EBITDA would continue at its then-current level for the remaining term of the facility and (ii) in November 2008 so that the permitted ratio of debt to EBITDA would be temporarily increased until the earlier of December 31, 2009 or CenterPoint Houston’s issuance of bonds to securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike, after which time the permitted
ratio would revert to the level that existed prior to the November 2008 modification.CenterPoint Houston’s $289 million credit facility’s first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston’s current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and other securitization bonds) to total capitalization covenant.CERC Corp.’s $950 million credit facility’s first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp.’s current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt to total capitalization covenant.Under CenterPoint Energy’s $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston’s $289 million credit facility and CERC Corp.’s $950 million credit facility, an additional utilization fee of 5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the utilization fee fluctuatebased on the borrower’s credit rating. &amp

Debt: Our debt consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 Weighted Average Interest Rate Amount Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Amount Outstanding Global Line 0.88% $ 247,397 2.38% $ 2,617,764 Credit Facility 1.28% 606,864 2.81% 600,519 Senior and other notes 5.54% 3,601,639 5.60% 3,995,410 Convertible senior notes (1) 5.55% 2,164,500 5.56% 2,590,133 Secured debt 6.83% 1,238,488 6.79% 877,916 Assessment bonds 6.52% 27,137 6.55% 29,626 Totals 5.28% $ 7,886,025 4.75 % $ 10,711,368 __________ (1) The weighted average interest rate reflects the effective rate after the adoption of ASC 470-20 (see Note 1 for more information on the adoption). The weighted coupon interest rate was 2.2% for both periods. As of June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. During 2009, in connection with our announced initiatives to reduce debt, we repurchased several series of notes outstanding at a discount, as follows (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2009 For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 Convertible Notes Original principal amount $ 473,057 $ 521,257 Cash purchase price $ 313,256 $ 338,077 Senior Notes (1) Original principal amount $ 343,192 $ 343,192 Cash purchase price $ 302,090 $ 302,090 Total Original principal amount $ 816,249 $ 864,449 Cash purchase price $ 615,346 $ 640,167 Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt (2) $ 143,280 $ 161,208 __________ (1) Included in the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 is the repurchase of €97.7 million ($136.0 million) original principal amount of our Euro senior notes for €82.6 million ($115.1 million). (2) Although we reduced our debt obligations by $200.9 million and $224.3 million in the three months and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, the gain is calculated based on the recorded debt balance, net of the discount. Unsecured Credit Facilities At June 30, 2009, our credit facilities provided aggregate borrowing capacity of $4.3 billion. This includes our global line of credit, where a syndicate of banks allows us to draw funds in U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, South Korean won and Canadian dollar (“Global Line”). This also includes a multi-currency credit facility that allows us to borrow in U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and British pound sterling (“Credit Facility”) and a 13.4 million British pound sterling facility (“Sterling Facility”). The total commitments under our credit facilities fluctuate in U.S. dollars based on the underlying currencies. Based on our public debt ratings, interest on the borrowings under the Global Line and Credit Facility primarily accrues at a variable rate based upon the interbank offered rate in each respective jurisdiction in which the borrowings are outstanding (1.16% per annum at June 30, 2009 based on a weighted average using local currency rates). The Global Line was scheduled to mature in October 2009. In July 2009, we exercised our option to extend the maturity to October 2010. We are currently in discussions with the lead banks to amend the Global Line with an overall commitment of $2.1 to $2.3 billion and extend the maturity to 2012. The Credit Facility matures in October 2009 and we have a similar option to extend the maturity to October 2010, subject to certain customary conditions and the payment of an extension fee. The Credit Facility provides us the ability to re-borrow, within a specified period of time, any amounts repaid on the facility. We expect we will repay the Credit Facility with borrowings under the Global Line once it has been amended and extended or we may extend the Credit Facility. During the first quarter of 2009, we reduced the commitment of the Sterling Facility, which matures December 31, 2009, to the balance of the outstanding letters of credit. As of June 30, 2009, under these facilities, we had outstanding borrowings of $854.3 million and letters of credit of $127.7 million, resulting in remaining borrowing capacity of approximately $3.3 billion, which we expect to be reduced as discussed above. Convertible Notes We issued three series of convertible senior notes in 2007 and 2008 and refer to them in the aggregate as “Convertible Notes”. The Convertible Notes are senior obligations of ProLogis and are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash, our common shares or a combination of cash and our common shares, at our option, at a conversion rate per $1,000 of principal amount of the notes of 13.1614 shares for the March 2007 issuance, 12.2926 shares for the November 2007 issuance and 13.1203 shares for the May 2008 issuance. The initial conversion price ($76.58 for the March 2007 issuance, $82.00 for the November 2007 issuance and $76.22 for the May 2008 issuance) represented a premium of approximately 20% over the closing price of our common shares at the date of first sale and is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Convertible Notes, issued in 2007 and 2008, are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 and 2013, respectively, for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and at any time prior to maturity to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a REIT. Holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes for cash on specific dates approximately every five years beginning in 2012 and 2013 and at any time prior to their maturity upon certain limited circumstances. Therefore, we have reflected these amounts in 2012 and 2013 in the schedule of debt maturities below based on the first redemption date and we will amortize the discount through these dates. While we have the legal right to settle the conversion in either cash or shares, we intend to settle the principal balance of the Convertible Notes in cash and, therefore, we have not included the effect of the conversion of these notes in our computation of diluted earnings per share. Based on the current conversion rates, 30.8 million shares would be required to settle the principal amount in shares. Such potentially dilutive shares, and the corresponding adjustment to interest expense, are not included in our computation of diluted earnings per share. The amount in excess of the principal balance of the notes (the “Conversion Spread”) will be settled in cash or, at our option, ProLogis common shares. If the Conversion Spread becomes dilutive to our earnings per share, (i.e., if our share price exceeds $75.98 for the March 2007 issuance, $81.35 for the November 2007 issuance and $76.22 for the May 2008 issuance) we will include the shares in our computation of diluted earnings per share. After the adoption of ASC 470-20, as discussed in Note 1, below is the detail related to the Convertible Notes (in thousands): June 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 Principal amount $ 2,399,243 $ 2,920,500 Discount (234,743) (330,367) Net carrying balance $ 2,164,500 $ 2,590,133 Additional paid-in capital – conversion option $ 381,493 $ 381,493 Interest expense related to the Convertible Notes includes the following components (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Coupon rate $ 14,156 $ 14,351 $ 30,049 $ 26,634 Amortization of discount 17,978 18,006 38,161 33,837 Amortization of deferred loan costs 833 843 1,815 1,493 Interest expense $ 32,967 $ 33,200 $ 70,025 $ 61,964 Effective interest rate 5.54% 5.83% 5.55% 5.46% Secured Debt During the second quarter of 2009, we issued $391.7 million in secured debt including $101.8 million at 6.5% due July 2014, $245.5 million at 7.55% due July 2019 and a ¥4.3 billion TMK bond ($44.4 million at June 30, 2009) at 4.09% (effective fixed rate including interest rate swap contract) that matures in June 2012. TMK bonds are a financing vehicle in Japan for special purpose companies known as TMKs. These financings are secured by 65 real estate properties with an aggregate undepreciated cost of $1.2 billion at June 30, 2009. Long-Term Debt Maturities Principal payments due on our debt, excluding the Global Line and Credit Facility, for the remainder of 2009 and for each of the years in the five-year period ending December 31, 2014 and thereafter are as follows (in thousands): 2009 (1) $ 282,656 2010 (1) 249,712 2011 (1) 401,374 2012 (2) 1,701,170 2013 1,615,333 2014 (2)(3) 167,797 Thereafter 2,822,762 Total principal due 7,240,804 Less: discount, net 209,040 Net carrying balance $ 7,031,764 __________ (1) We expect to repay the amounts maturing in 2009 with borrowings under our credit facilities and the amounts maturing in 2010 and 2011 with borrowings under our Global Line or with proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities, depending on market conditions. (2) The maturities in 2012 and 2013 include the aggregate principal amounts of convertible notes of $1,122.5 million and $1,276.8 million, respectively, based on the year in which the holders first have the right to require us to repurchase their notes. (3) The November 2007 issuance of convertible notes is included as a 2013 maturity since the holders have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash in January 2013. The holders of these notes also have the option to convert their notes in November 2012, which we may settle in cash or common shares, at our option. /*<![CDATA[*/ st1:*{behavior:url(#ieooui) } <!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} p.MsoHeader, li.MsoHeader, div.MsoHeader {margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; tab-stops:center 3.0in right 6.0in; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} /* List Definitions */ @list l0 {mso-list-id:79570285; mso-list-type:hybrid; mso-list-template-ids:106472802 -2042726808 67698713 67698715 67698703 67698713 67698715 67698703 67698713 67698715;} @list l0:level1 {mso-level-text:""(%1)""; mso-level-tab-stop:22.5pt; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:22.5pt; text-indent:-.25in;} @list l1 {mso-list-id:2113815891; mso-list-type:hybrid; mso-list-template-ids:-283715952 -2042726808 67698713 67698715 67698703 67698713 67698715 67698703 67698713 67698715;} @list l1:level1 {mso-level-text:""(%1)""; mso-level-tab-stop:22.5pt; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:22.5pt; text-indent:-.25in;} ol {margin-bottom:0in;} ul {margin-bottom:0in;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} /*]]>*/ "

Debt In November 2006, we issued
our Notes for total gross proceeds of $3.45 billion. The Notes are
senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other
existing and future senior unsecured debt. Holders may convert
their Notes at their option on any day prior to the close of
business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
(i) September 1, 2011, with respect to the 2011 Notes,
and (ii) September 1, 2013, with respect to the 2013
Notes, in each case only under the following circumstances:
(1) during the five business-day period after any five
consecutive trading-day period (the “measurement
period”) in which the price per Note of the applicable series
for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the
product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the
conversion rate on each such day; (2) during any calendar
quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20
or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in
effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
calendar quarter; or (3) upon the occurrence of certain events
specified in the Notes. Additionally, the Notes will become
convertible during the last three months prior to the respective
maturities of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. Upon conversion, we will pay
cash up to the principal amount of the debt converted. With respect
to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the
Notes converted, we have the option to settle the excess with cash,
shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of
our common stock based on a daily conversion value, determined in
accordance with the indenture, calculated on a proportionate basis
for each day of the relevant 20-day observation period. The initial
conversion rate for the Notes will be 62.1978 shares of our common
stock per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, which
represents a 27.5% conversion premium from the date the Notes were
issued and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately
$16.08 per share of our common stock. The conversion price is
subject to adjustment in some events as set forth in the indenture.
In addition, if a “fundamental change” (as defined in
the indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some
cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of Notes that
elects to convert its Notes in connection with such fundamental
change. The Notes pay interest in
cash at a rate of 1.75% semi-annually in arrears on December 1
and June 1 of each year. In connection with the sale
of the Notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge
transactions with respect to our common stock (the “Purchased
Options”). The Purchased Options allow us to receive shares
of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion
value that we would pay to the holders of the Notes upon
conversion. The Purchased Options will cover, subject to customary
anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million shares of
our common stock. Half of the Purchased Options expire on
December 1, 2011 and the remaining half of the Purchased
Options expire on December 1, 2013. We paid an aggregate
amount of $669.1 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes
for the Purchased Options. We also entered into separate
transactions in which we sold warrants to acquire, subject to
customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million
shares of our common stock at an exercise price of approximately
$19.55 per share of our common stock. Half of the Sold Warrants
have expiration dates between February 15, 2012 and
March 15, 2012 and the remaining half of the Sold Warrants
have expiration dates between February 18, 2014 and
March 18, 2014. We received aggregate proceeds of $391.1
million from the sale of the Sold Warrants. The Purchased Options and
Sold Warrants will generally have the effect of increasing the
conversion price of the Notes to approximately $19.55 per share of
our common stock, representing an approximate 55% conversion
premium based on the closing price of $12.61 per share of our
common stock on November 13, 2006. The carrying amount reported
in the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2009 for our
long-term convertible debt was $3,045.0 million. The fair value of
the long-term convertible debt as of June 30, 2009 was
$3,560.0 million based on active market prices for the
debt. The following tables

June 30, 2009 and 2008. The carrying amount of the equity
component was $669.1 million at both June 30, 2009 and

The senior credit agreement, as amended in May 2007, provides for a facility of $450,000, and includes a provision which permits future incremental increases of up to $100,000 in total availability under the facility. We can issue up to $450,000 under the letter of credit facility. A portion of the letters of credit issued under the domestic senior credit agreement have performance pricing that is decreased (or increased) as a result of improvements (or reductions) in the credit rating of the domestic senior credit agreement as reported by Moody’s Investors Service and/or Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”). We also have the option to use up to $100,000 of the $450,000 for revolving borrowings at a rate equal to adjusted LIBOR plus 1.50%, subject also to the performance pricing noted above. As a result of the improvement in our S&P credit rating in March 2007, we achieved, and continue to maintain, the lowest possible pricing under the performance pricing provisions of our domestic senior credit agreement. On December 18, 2008, Foster Wheeler AG, Foster Wheeler Ltd., certain of Foster Wheeler Ltd.’s subsidiaries and BNP Paribas, as Administrative Agent, entered into an additional amendment of our domestic senior credit agreement. The amendment includes a consent of the lenders under the credit agreement to the Redomestication. In addition, the amendment reflects the addition of Foster Wheeler AG as a guarantor of the obligations under the credit agreement and reflects changes relating to Foster Wheeler AG becoming the ultimate parent of Foster Wheeler Ltd. and its subsidiaries upon completion of the Redomestication. The amendment became effective upon consummation of the Redomestication on February 9, 2009. We had approximately $290,800 and $273,500 of letters of credit outstanding under this agreement as of June 30, 2009 and December 26, 2008, respectively. The letter of credit fees ranged from 1.50% to 1.60% of the outstanding amount, excluding a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum. There were no funded borrowings under this agreement as of June 30, 2009 or December 26, 2008. During the fiscal six months ended June 30, 2009, one of our subsidiaries based in China, which is 52% owned by us and which we consolidate into our financial statements, repaid its outstanding term loan at the scheduled maturity date. Also during the fiscal six months ended June 30, 2009, the same China based subsidiary entered into a new term loan for 20 million CNY (approximately $2,930 at the exchange rate in effect at the inception of the term loan) with an interest rate of 4.86% and which matures on July 6, 2009. Subsequent to the fiscal six months ended June 30, 2009, the term loan was repaid at the scheduled maturity date. Also subsequent to the fiscal six months ended June 30, 2009, our China based subsidiary entered into a new term loan for 20 million CNY (approximately $2,926 at the exchange rate in effect at the inception of the term loan) with an interest rate of 4.374% and which matures on January 8, 2010. During the second fiscal quarter of 2009 we adopted FASB Staff Position No. FSP FAS 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) 28-1, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (“FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1”). FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 amends SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Values of Financial Instruments,” to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements. Additionally, FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 also amends APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require those disclosures in all interim financial statements. The estimated fair values of our long-term debt were $217,913 and $227,866 as of June 30, 2009 and December 26, 2008, respectively. We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt (including current installments) based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered for debt of the same remaining maturities. /*<![CDATA[*/ st1:*{behavior:url(#ieooui) } <!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:""CG Times""; panose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-format:other; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;} /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; text-autospace:none; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} p.MsoBodyText2, li.MsoBodyText2, div.MsoBodyText2 {margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; mso-outline-level:1; tab-stops:1.0in 2.05in decimal 224.1pt left 282.6pt decimal 341.1pt left 386.1pt 485.1pt; text-autospace:none; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} p.MsoBodyText3, li.MsoBodyText3, div.MsoBodyText3 {margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:9.0pt; margin-left:0in; text-align:justify; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:""CG Times""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-bidi-font-family:""CG Times"";} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} /*]]>*/ "

6,2009-08-05,46765,XBRL," 11. Debt At June 30, 2009, the Company had the
following unsecured long-term debt outstanding (in thousands): Maturity Date Interest Rate Fixed rate debt: August 15, 2009 5.91% $ 25,000 August 15, 2012 6.46% 75,000 August 15, 2014 6.56% 75,000 Senior credit facility: December 18, 2011 .67%-.68% 280,000 455,000 Less long-term debt due within one year 25,000 Long-term debt $ 430,000 The terms of the fixed rate debt obligations
require the Company to maintain a minimum ratio of debt to total
capitalization. The Company has an agreement with a multi-bank
syndicate for a $400 million senior unsecured credit facility which matures
December 2011. While the Company has the option to borrow at the
prime rate for maturities of less than 30 days, the Company anticipates that the
majority of all of the borrowings over the life of the facility will accrue
interest at a spread over the London Interbank Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company pays a commitment fee based on the unused balance of the
facility. The spread over LIBOR as well as the commitment fee is
determined according to a scale based on a ratio of the Companys total debt to
total capitalization. The spread ranges from .30 percent to .45 percent
over LIBOR depending on the ratios. At June 30, 2009, the spread on
borrowings was .35 percent over LIBOR and the commitment fee was .075 percent
per annum. At June 30, 2009, the Company had two letters of credit
totaling $20.9 million under the facility and had $280 million borrowed against
the facility with $99.1 million available to borrow. The advances bear interest
ranging from 0.67 percent to 0.68 percent. Subsequent to June 30,
2009, the debt was reduced by $115 million with proceeds from a new facility
discussed below. Short-term debt consists of a $105 million
unsecured line of credit that will mature January 2010. The Company
closed on the agreement with a five-bank syndicate January 21, 2009. The Company anticipates that this loan will remain funded for the entire term
and that all borrowings will accrue interest at a spread over 30 day LIBOR. The
spread over LIBOR is determined according to the same scale of debt to total
capitalization used in the Companys $400 million facility which is described in
the preceding paragraph. The spread over LIBOR for the new facility has
increased to a range of 2 percent to 2.75 percent. At June 30, 2009,
the spread on the borrowing was 2.25 percent over LIBOR. Simultaneous with
the closing of this facility, the Company entered into an interest-rate swap
with the same maturity and a notional amount of $105 million. The Company
believes that the swap will act to fix the annualized interest rate of the
facility at approximately 3.17 percent assuming the spread remains at 2.25
percent over LIBOR. For further information regarding the interest rate
swap, refer to Note 7 of these consolidated condensed financial
statements. Financial covenants in both facilities require the
Company to maintain a funded leverage ratio (as defined) of less than 50 percent
and an interest coverage ratio (as defined) of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. Both facilities contain additional terms, conditions, and restrictions that the
Company believes are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for
companies that are similar in size and credit quality. At June 30,
2009, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Additionally, as of June 30, 2009, the
Company had unsecured letters of credit totaling $3.3 million which were used to
obtain surety bonds for the international operations. On
July 21, 2009, the Company closed on a private placement and received
proceeds of $200 million from senior unsecured fixed-rate notes that will mature
July 2016. Interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually based on
an annual rate of 6.10 percent. The Company will make five equal annual
principal repayments of $40 million starting on the third anniversary of the
closing date. Financial covenants require the Company to maintain a funded
leverage ratio of less than 55 percent and an interest coverage ratio (as
defined) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. The note purchase agreement also
contains additional terms, conditions, and restrictions that the Company
believes are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for companies
that are similar in size and credit quality. The $200 million proceeds
from this facility will be used to fund capital expenditures, repay indebtedness
and for other general corporate purposes. "

The fair value of debt is estimated based on quoted market prices, current market rates for similar debt within approximately the same remaining maturities, or discounted cash flow models utilizing current market rates. Fair value of debt reflects interest accrued but not yet paid. Interest ac
crued on Automotive sector debt is reported in Accrued liabilities and deferred revenue and was $364 million and $438 million at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Interest accrued on Financial Services sector debt is reported in Other liabilities and deferred income and was $815 million and $1.3 billion at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The change in the fair value of our debt in the first half of 2009 was primarily driven by improvements in the credit markets generally, reduced supply of outstanding debt within the Automotive sector, and an improved market view of Ford specifically.

Convertible Notes&
lt;/font> The Convertible Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.25% per annum. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of Ford Common Stock, based on a conversion rate (subject to adjustment) of 108.6957 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equal to a conversion price of $9.20 per share, representing a 25% conversion premium based on the closing price of $7.36 per share on December 6, 2006). Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes for cash on December 20, 2016 and December&
amp;#160;15, 2026 or upon a change in control of the Company, or for shares of Ford Common Stock upon a designated event, in each case for a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes at our option at any time or from time to time on or after December 20, 2016 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. We also may terminate the conversion rights at any time on or after December 20, 2013 if the closing price of Ford Common Stock exceeds 140% of the then-prevailing conversion price for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period. We applied FSP APB 14-1 retroactively to all periods presented following our adoption of this FSP on January 1, 2009. Conversion Offer. Pursuant to an exchange offer we conducted, on the settlement date of April 8, 2009, $4.3 billion principal amount of Convertible Notes was exchanged for an aggregate of 467,909,227 shares of Ford Common Stock, $344 million in cash ($80 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Note

The total effective rate on the liability component was 10.5%. Subordinated Convertible Debentures At June 30, 2009, we had outstanding $3 billion of 6.50% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2032 (""Subordinated Convertible Debentures"") to Trust II, a subsidiary trust. The Subordinated Convertible Debentures are the sole assets of Trust II. As of January 15, 2007, the Subordinated Convertible Debentures have become redeemable at our option. At June 30, 2009, Trust II had outstanding 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities with an aggregate liquidation preference of $2.8 billion (""Trust Preferred Securities""). We guarantee the payment of all distribution and other payments of the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent not paid by Trust II, but only if and to the extent we have made a payment of interest or principal on the Subordinated Convertible Debentures. Trust II is not consolidated by us as it is a VIE in which we do not have a significant variable interest and of which we are not the primary beneficiary. As announced on March 27, 2009, we elected to defer future interest payments related to the Trust Preferred Securities for up to 5 years. As of June 30, 20
09, $46 million of interest has been deferred and is reported in Automotive long-term debt. During the first quarter of 2009, pursuant to a request for conversion, we issued an aggregate of 2,437,562 shares of Ford Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in exchange for $43 million principal amount of our Subordinated Convertible Debentures. Secured Term Loan and Revolving Loan Pursuant to our December 2006 Credit Agreement, at June 30, 2009, we had outstanding $4.6 billion of a secured term loan maturing on December 15, 2013 and $10.1 billion of revolving loans maturing on December 15, 2011. The term loan principal amount amortizes at a rate of $70 million (1% of original loan) per annum and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00%. The revolving loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%. Under the Credit Agreement, we may designate certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries, including Ford Credit, as borrowers under the revolving facility. We and certain of our domestic subsidiaries that constitute a substantial portion of our domestic Automotive assets (excluding cash) are guarantors under the Credit Agreement, and future material domestic subsidiaries will become guarantors when formed or acquired. Collateral. The borrowings of the Company, the s
ubsidiary borrowers, and the guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by a substantial portion of our domestic Automotive assets (excluding cash). The collateral includes a majority of our principal domestic manufacturing facilities, excluding facilities to be closed, subject to limitations set forth in existing public indentures and other unsecured credit agreements; domestic accounts receivable; domestic inventory; up to $4 billion of marketable securities or cash proceeds therefrom; 100% of the stock of our principal domestic subsidiaries, including Ford Credit (but excluding the assets of Ford Credit); certain intercompany notes of Volvo Holding Company Inc., a holding company for Volvo, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited (""Ford Canada"") and Grupo Ford S. de R.L. de C.V. (a Mexican subsidiary); 66% to 100% of the stock of all major first tier foreign subsidiaries (including Volvo); and certain domestic intellectual property, including trademarks. Covenants. The Credit Agreement requires ongoing compliance with a borrowing base covenant and contains other restrictive covenants, including a restriction on our ability to pay dividends. The Credit Agreement prohibits the payment of dividends (other than dividends payable solely in stock) on Ford Common and Class B Stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a liquidity covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in the aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, loaned and marketable securities and short-term Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (""VEBA"") assets and/or availability under the revolving credit facility. With respect to the borrowing base covenant, we are required to limit the outstanding amount of debt under the Credit Agreement as well as certain permitted additional indebtedness secured by the collateral described above such that the total debt outstanding does not exceed the value of the collateral as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Events of Default. In addition to customary payment, representation, bankruptcy and judgment defaults, the Credit Agreement contains cross-payment and cross-acceleration defaults with respect to other debt for borrowed money and a change in control default. Secured Revolving Loan Draw. Due to concerns about the instability in the capital markets and the uncertain state of the global economy, on February 3, 2009, we borrowed $10.1 billion under the revolving credit facility of the Credit Agreement to ensure access to these funds. Secured Term Loan Repurchase. On March 27, 2009, Ford Credit purchased from the lenders thereof $2.2 billion principal amount of our secured term loan under the Credit Agreement for an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion (including transaction costs). Consistent with previously announced plans to return capital from Ford Credit to us, Ford Credit distributed the repurchased secured term loan to its immediate parent, Ford Holdings, whereupon the debt was forgiven. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.
1 billion in Automotive interest income and other non-operating income/(expense), net in the first quarter of 2009. Financial Services Sector Unsecured Debt Debt Repurchases. In the first quarter of 2009, through private market transactions, our Financial Services sector repurchased an aggregate of $341 million principal amount of its outstanding unsecured notes for $279 million in cash. As a result, Financial Services sector recorded a pre-tax gain of $65 million, net of unamortized discounts, premiums, and fees, in Financial Services other income/(loss), net in the first quarter of 2009 ($51 million related to Ford Holdings and $14 million related to Ford Credit).

In September 2007, Nextel Brazil entered into a $300.0 million syndicated loan facility. Of the total amount of the facility, $45.0 million is denominated in U.S. dollars with a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% (Tranche A — 2.60% and 3.43% as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively). The remaining $255.0 million is denominated in U.S. dollars with a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% (Tranche B — 2.35% and 3.18% as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively). Tranche A matures on September 14, 2014, and Tranche B matures on September 14, 2012. In addition, a portion of Nextel Mexico’s syndicated loan facility bears a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. The interest rate on the portions of both the Brazil and Mexico syndicated loan facilities that have interest rates based on LIBOR are reset each quarter. If the LIBOR rate increases, Nextel Brazil and Nextel Mexico will incur increased interest expense related to their syndicated loans. Brazil Import Financing. In March 2009, Nextel Brazil began financing certain equipment mainly purchased from Motorola and Research in Motion, or RIM, that is imported into Brazil through agreements with several Brazilian banks. Each tranche of these financings matures within a six to twelve-month period. Brazil Credit Paper. In May 2009, Nextel Brazil entered into a $25.6 million working capital loan with a Brazilian bank. Interest is payable quarterly for the first twelve months beginning August 2009 and monthly for the remaining six months, and the principal matures beginning in June 2010 through November 2010 with six equal consecutive payments. /*<![CDATA[*/ <!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:Batang; panose-1:2 3 6 0 0 1 1 1 1 1; mso-font-alt:; mso-font-charset:129; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-format:other; mso-font-pitch:fixed; mso-font-signature:1 151388160 16 0 524288 0;} @font-face {font-family:""Cambria Math""; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} @font-face {font-family:""@Batang""; panose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; mso-font-charset:129; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-format:other; mso-font-pitch:fixed; mso-font-signature:1 151388160 16 0 524288 0;} /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman"",""serif""; mso-fareast-font-family:Batang;} .MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-size:10.0pt; mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Batang;} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} /*]]>*/ "

June 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 Short Long Short Long (Dollars in millions) Term Term Total Term Term Total Unsecured borrowings $ 4,249 $ 28,416 $ 32,665 $ 6,794 $ 31,182 $ 37,976 Term bank deposits 901 5,199 6,100 1,148 1,108 2,256 Indentured trusts 8 1,761 1,769 31 1,972 2,003 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities 12,476 — 12,476 24,768 — 24,768 ED Participation Program facility 17,236 — 17,236 7,365 — 7,365 ED Conduit Program facility 11,095 — 11,095 — — — On-balance sheet securitizations — 87,386 87,386 — 80,601 80,601 Other 1,358 — 1,358 1,827 — 1,827 Total before fair value adjustments 47,323 122,762 170,085 41,933 114,863 156,796 SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustments 9 3,118 3,127 — 3,362 3,362 Total $ 47,332 $ 125,880 $ 173,212 $ 41,933 $ 118,225 $ 160,158 As of June 30, 2009, the Company had $3.5 billion in unsecured revolving credit facilities which provide liquidity support for general corporate purposes. The Company has never drawn on these facilities. The facilities include a $1.9 billion revolving credit facility maturing in October 2010 and $1.6 billion maturing in October 2011. These figures do not include a $215 million commitment from a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc. On April 24, 2009, in conjunction with the extension of the 2008 ABCP Facilities, a $1.4 billion revolving credit facility maturing in October 2009 was retired and a $1.9 billion revolving credit facility maturing in October 2011 was reduced to $1.6 billion. In connection with the early termination of the unsecured revolving credit facilities, interest on these facilities, if drawn, increases to LIBOR plus 450 basis points. The principal financial covenants in the unsecured revolving credit facilities require the Company to maintain tangible net worth of at least $1.38 billion at all times. Consolidated tangible net worth as calculated for purposes of this covenant was $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2009. The covenants also require the Company to meet either a minimum interest coverage ratio or a minimum net adjusted revenue test based on the four preceding quarters’ adjusted “Core Earnings” financial performance. The Company was compliant with both the minimum interest coverage ratio and the minimum net adjusted revenue tests as of the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Failure to meet these covenants would result in the facilities being withdrawn. In the past, the Company has not relied upon its unsecured revolving credit facilities as a primary source of liquidity. Although the Company has never borrowed under these facilities, they are available to be drawn upon for general corporate purposes. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., is a party to the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facilities under which they provide the Company with a $215 million commitment. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. declared bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. The Company is operating under the assumption that the lending commitment of Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, will not be honored if drawn upon. While the Company continues to explore various options, it does not anticipate replacing its commitment from Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB. Secured Borrowings FIN No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” requires VIEs to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries. A VIE exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself, or the equity investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest. Those characteristics are the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity’s activities that have a significant impact on the success of the entity, the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity, and the rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. The Company currently consolidates a number of financing entities that are VIEs as a result of being the entities’ primary beneficiary. As a result, these financing VIEs are accounted for as secured borrowings. The process of identifying the primary beneficiary involves identifying all other parties that hold variable interests in the entity and determining which of the parties, including the Company, has the responsibility to absorb the majority of the entity’s expected losses or the rights to its expected residual returns. The Company is the primary beneficiary of and currently consolidates the following financing VIEs as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008: June 30, 2009 Debt Outstanding Short Long Carrying Amount of Assets Securing Debt Outstanding (Dollars in millions) Term Term Total Loans Cash Other Assets Total Secured Borrowings: ED Participation Program facility $ 17,236 $ — $ 17,236 $ 17,472 $ 127 $ 243 $ 17,842 ED Conduit Program facility 11,095 — 11,095 11,390 204 353 11,947 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities(1) 12,476 — 12,476 13,707 346 126 14,179 On-balance sheet securitizations — 87,386 87,386 90,161 3,523 2,816 96,500 Indentured trusts 8 1,761 1,769 2,253 189 31 2,473 40,815 89,147 129,962 134,983 4,389 3,569 142,941 SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustment — 1,307 1,307 — — — — Total $ 40,815 $ 90,454 $ 131,269 $ 134,983 $ 4,389 $ 3,569 $ 142,941 (1) Includes $95 million of assets within the facility that can be released to the Company.

The initial term of the 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities was 364 days. The underlying cost of borrowing under the 2008 ABCP Facilities was approximately LIBOR plus 0.68 percent for the FFELP loan facilities and LIBOR plus 1.55 percent for the Private Education Loan facility, excluding up-front and unused commitment fees. All-in pricing on the 2008 ABCP Facilities varies based on usage. For the full year 2008, the combined, all-in cost of borrowings related to the 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities, including amortized up-front fees and unused commitment fees, was three-month LIBOR plus 2.47 percent. The primary use of the 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities was to refinance comparable ABCP facilities incurred in connection with the Proposed Merger, with the expectation that outstanding balances under the 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities would be reduced through securitization of the underlying student loan collateral in the term asset-backed securities (“ABS”) market. On February 2, 2009, the Company extended the maturity date of the 2008 ABCP Facilities from February 28, 2009 to April 28, 2009 for a $61 million upfront fee. The other terms of the facilities remained materially unchanged. On February 27, 2009, the Company extended the maturity date of the 2008 Asset-Backed Loan Facility from February 28, 2009 to April 28, 2009 for a $4 million upfront fee. The other terms of this facility remained materially unchanged. On April 24, 2009, the Company extended the maturity of $21.8 billion of the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility for one year to April, 23, 2010. The Company also extended its 2008 Asset-Backed Loan Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion. The 2008 Asset-Backed Loan Facility matured on June 26, 2009 and was paid in full. A total of $86 million in fees were paid related to these extensions. The 2008 Private Education Loan ABCP Facility was paid off and terminated on April 24, 2009. The stated borrowing rate of the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility is the applicable funding rate plus 130 basis points excluding upfront fees. The applicable funding rate generally will be either a LIBOR or commercial paper rate. The terms of the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility call for an increase in the applicable funding spread to 300 basis points if the outstanding borrowing amount is not reduced to $15.2 billion and $10.9 billion as of June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, respectively. If the Company does not negotiate an extension or pay off all outstanding amounts of the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility at maturity, the facility will extend by 90 days with the interest rate generally increasing to LIBOR plus 250 basis points to 550 basis points over the 90 day period. The other terms of the facilities remained materially unchanged. The maximum amount the Company may borrow under the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility is limited based on certain factors, including market conditions and the fair value of student loans in the facility. As of June 30, 2009, the maximum borrowing amount was approximately $14.8 billion under the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility. Funding under the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility is subject to usual and customary conditions. The 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility is subject to termination under certain circumstances, including the Company’s failure to comply with the principal financial covenants in its unsecured revolving credit facilities. Borrowings under the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility are nonrecourse to the Company. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had $12.5 billion outstanding in connection with the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility. The book basis of the assets securing this facility as of June 30, 2009 was $14.2 billion. ED Conduit Program Pursuant to the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (“ECASLA”), on January 15, 2009, ED published summary terms under which it will purchase eligible FFELP Stafford and PLUS loans from a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for eligible student lenders (the “ED Conduit Program”). Loans eligible for the ED Conduit Program must be first disbursed on or after October 1, 2003, but not later than July 1, 2009, and fully disbursed before September 30, 2009, and meet certain other requirements including with respect to borrower benefits. The ED Conduit was launched on May 11, 2009. Funding for the ED Conduit Program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates, with the Company being advanced 97 percent of the student loan face amount. The ED Conduit Program has a term of five years and will expire on January 19, 2014. The Student Loan Short-Term Notes (“SLST Notes”), issued by the ED Conduit, are supported by a combination of i) Funding Notes backed by FFELP student loans, ii) the Liquidity Agreement with the Federal Financing Bank (“FFB”) and iii) the Put Agreement provided by ED. If the conduit does not have sufficient funds to pay all SLST Notes then those SLST Notes will be repaid with funds from the FFB. The FFB will hold the notes for a short period of time and if at the end of that time the SLST Notes still cannot be paid off, the underlying FFELP loans that serve as collateral to the ED Conduit will be sold to ED through the Put Agreement at a price of 97 percent of the face amount of the loans. Approximately $15.5 billion of the Company’s Stafford and PLUS loans (excluding loans currently in the Participation Program) are eligible for funding under the ED Conduit Program. As of June 30, 2009, $11.4 billion of these assets have been funded through this program with a weighted average issuance cost of approximately .74 percent. Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (“TALF”) On February 6, 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published proposed terms for a program designed to facilitate renewed issuance of consumer and small business ABS at lower interest rate spreads. TALF was initiated on March 17, 2009 and currently provides investors with funding of up to five years for eligible ABS rated by two or more rating agencies in the highest investment-grade rating category. Eligible ABS include ‘AAA’ rated student loan ABS backed by FFELP and private student loans first disbursed since May 1, 2007. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had approximately $12.7 billion book basis ($13.4 billion face amount) of student loans eligible to serve as collateral for ABS funded under TALF; this amount does not include loans eligible for ECASLA financing programs. The Federal Reserve Bank launched the TALF program on March 3, 2009. On May 5, 2009, the Company priced a $2.6 billion Private Education Loan securitization which closed on May 12, 2009. The issue bears a coupon of 1-month LIBOR plus 6.0 percent and is callable at the Company’s option at 93 percent of the outstanding balance of the ABS between November 15, 2011 and April 15, 2012. If the issue is called on November 15, 2011, which the Company believes is probable, the effective cost of the bond financing will be approximately 1-month LIBOR plus 3.7 percent. This transaction was TALF-eligible. This securitization is accounted for as a secured borrowing. The Company has concluded that it is probable it will call these bonds at the call date at the 7 percent discount. Probability is based on the Company’s assessment on whether these bonds can be refinanced at the call date at or lower than a breakeven cost of funds based on the call discount. As a result, the Company is accreting this call discount as a reduction to interest expense through the call date under APB No. 21, “Interest on Receivables and Payables,” and SFAS No. 91, “Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases.” If it becomes less than probable the Company will call these bonds at a future date it will result in the Company reversing this prior accretion as a cumulative catch up under SFAS No. 91 and the effective interest rate method. The Company has accreted approximately $9 million as a reduction of interest expense through June 30, 2009. Consolidation of Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations In the second quarter of 2009, three of the Company’s off-balance sheet securitization trusts were re-evaluated under SFAS No. 140 and it was determined that they no longer met the criteria to be considered QSPEs. These trusts were then evaluated as VIEs using the guidance in FIN No. 46(R) and it was determined that they should be consolidated and accounted for as secured borrowings as the Company is the primary beneficiary. These trusts had reached their 10 percent clean-up call levels but the call was not exercised by the Company. Under SFAS No. 140, because the Company can now exercise that option at their discretion going forward, the Company effectively controls the assets of the trusts. This resulted in the Company consolidating at fair value $454 million in assets and $432 million in liabilities related to these trusts. This resulted in an $11 million gain being recognized during the second quarter of 2009. "

6,2009-08-05,849399,XBRL," Note 4. Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments As of April 4, 2009, we adopted FSP APB No. 14-1, which requires issuers of certain types of convertible notes to separately account for the liability and equity components of such convertible notes in a manner that reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB No. 14-1 applies to the 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011 and the 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013, collectively referred to as the Senior Notes. Prior to the adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1, the liability of the Senior Notes was carried at its principal value and only the contractual interest expense was recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because FSP APB No. 14-1 requires retrospective adoption, we were required to adjust all periods for which the Senior Notes were outstanding before the date of adoption. Upon adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1 and effective as of the issuance date of the Senior Notes, we recorded $586 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 6.78% at the time of issuance and the coupon rate of the Senior Notes. This debt discount, recorded in additional paid-in capital, is amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the contractual terms of the Senior Notes using the effective interest method. In addition, we allocated $9 million of the issuance costs to the equity component of the Senior Notes and the remaining $24 million of the issuance costs to the debt component of the Senior Notes. The issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the relative carrying amounts of the debt and equity components. The $24 million of debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component is amortized as interest expense over the respective contractual terms of the Senior Notes using the effective interest method. Each $1,000 of principal of the Senior Notes will initially be convertible into 52.2951 shares of Symantec common stock, which is the equivalent of $19.12 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. As of July 3, 2009, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the discount and debt issuance costs is approximately 3 years and the if-converted value of the Senior Notes does not exceed the principal amount of the Senior Notes.

Utility Senior Notes On March 6, 2009, the Utility issued $550 million principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due March 1, 2039. On June 11, 2009, the Utility issued $500 million principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due June 10, 2010. The interest rate for the Floating Rate Senior Notes is equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 0.95% and will reset quarterly beginning on September 10, 2009. At June 30, 2009, the interest rate on the Floating Rate Senior Notes was 1.60%. 21 Credit Facility and Short-Term Borrowings At June 30, 2009, the Utility had $303 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Utility’s $1.94 billion revolving credit facility.

At June 30, 2009, we had $46.5 million of unrestricted
cash and cash equivalents and $55.7 million held in an Internal
Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange escrow account with a
qualified intermediary, for net cash available of $91.8
million. The principal amounts due at
maturity above reflect our intent to extend $86.6 million of 2009
maturities to 2010 pursuant to our extension options with the
lenders. As of June 30, 2009, our
joint venture partners’ share of total debt was $159.9
million.
Unsecured Revolving Credit
Facilities In March 2009, we amended the
terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities to, among other
things, extend the maturity of a portion of the borrowing capacity
thereunder to April 26, 2012. In connection with the
amendments, we increased our aggregate borrowing capacity under the
unsecured revolving credit facilities to $867.0 million, of which
$277.0 million matures on April 26, 2010 and $590.0 million
matures in 2012. The U.S. credit facility also includes an
“accordion” feature that permits us to further expand
our aggregate borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion upon satisfaction
of certain conditions. Borrowings under our
unsecured revolving credit facilities bear interest at a
fluctuating rate per annum (based on U.S. or Canadian LIBOR, the
Canadian Bankers’ Acceptance rate, or the U.S. or Canadian
Prime rate), plus an applicable percentage based on our
consolidated leverage. At June 30, 2009, the applicable
percentage was 0.75% for 2010 maturities and 2.80% for 2012
maturities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities have a 20
basis point facility fee.
Senior Notes Offering In April 2009, we completed
the sale of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of
6 1/2% senior notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) of
Ventas Realty and a wholly owned subsidiary, Ventas Capital
Corporation (“Ventas Capital” and together with Ventas
Realty, the “Issuers”), at a 15 3/4% discount to par value, and received net proceeds of
$166.0 million. The 2016 Notes are
substantially similar in all respects to the Issuers’ other
6 1/2% senior notes due 2016, except that the 2016 Notes were
issued with original issue discount and, thus, are a separate
series from, and have a different CUSIP number than, the other
notes.
Debt Repayments, Purchases and Tender
Offers During the six months ended
June 30, 2009, we purchased in open market transactions and/or
through cash tender offers $361.6 million of our senior notes
composed of: $121.6 million principal amount of our outstanding
6 3/4% senior notes due 2010, $109.4 million principal amount
of our outstanding 9% senior notes due 2012, $103.3 million
principal amount of our outstanding 6 5/8% senior notes due 2014 and $27.3 million principal amount
of our outstanding 7 1/8% senior notes due 2015. We recognized a net loss on
extinguishment of debt of $6.0 million and $6.1 million for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively,
related to these transactions. We also repaid in full, at
par, $49.8 million principal amount of our outstanding 8 3/4% senior notes due 2009 at maturity on May 1, 2009,
and we repaid $33.4 million and $75.5 million in mortgage debt
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009,
respectively. We funded these repayments,
purchases and tender offers with the net proceeds from the sale of
the 2016 Notes, our concurrent offering of common stock and cash on
hand. See “Note 10 — Capital Stock.”
Mortgages In June 2009, we closed a
pool of sixteen first-mortgage loans aggregating $114.2 million,
secured by thirteen of our seniors housing communities leased to
Brookdale and three of our seniors housing communities leased to
another tenant. The loans mature in July 2019 and bear interest at
a fixed rate of 6.76% per annum. "

Credit Facilities, Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt Short-term borrowings are summarized as follows (in thousands of dollars): June 30 December 31 June 30 2009 2008 2008 Bank borrowings $46,000 $1,082,500 $1,209,500 Commercial paper 366,300 0 0 Total short-term borrowings $412,300 $1,082,500 $1,209,500 Bank borrowings Maturity 1 day 2 days 1 to 28 days Weighted-average interest rate 0.62% 1.63% 2.63% Commercial paper Maturity 1 to 43 days n/a n/a Weighted-average interest rate 0.72% n/a n/a We utilize our bank lines of credit as liquidity back-up for outstanding commercial paper or draw on the bank lines to access LIBOR-based short-term loans to fund our borrowing requirements. Periodically, we issue commercial paper for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements. We plan to continue this practice from time to time as circumstances warrant. Our policy is to maintain committed credit facilities at least equal to our outstanding commercial paper. Unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $1,675,000,000 were maintained at June 30, 2009, of which $175,000,000 expires November 16, 2009 and $1,500,000,000 expires November 16, 2012. As of June 30, 2009, $46,000,000 of the lines of credit was drawn. Interest rates referable to borrowings under these lines of credit are determined at the time of borrowing based on current market conditions. All lines of credit extended to us in 2009 and 2008 were based solely on a commitment fee; no compensating balances were required. In the normal course of business, we maintain balances for which we are credited with earnings allowances. To the extent the earnings allowances are not sufficient to fully compensate banks for the services they provide, we pay the fee equivalent for the differences.
As of June 30, 2009, $3,680,000 of our long-term debt, including current maturities, was secured. This secured debt was assumed with the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock. All other debt obligations, both short-term borrowings and long-term debt, are unsecured.
In February 2009, we issued $400,000,000 of long-term notes in two related series (tranches), as follows: $150,000,000 of 10.125% coupon notes due December 2015 and $250,000,000 of 10.375% coupon notes due December 2018. The notes were initially sold to Goldman Sachs pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), as amended, and subsequently resold to Berkshire Hathaway pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. In May 2009, these notes were exchanged for substantially identical notes that were registered under the Securities Act. The notes are presented in the table below net of unamortized discounts from par. Discounts and debt issuance costs are being amortized using the effective interest method over the respective lives of the notes.

The effective interest rate for these 10-year notes is 7.39%. 7 Includes decreases for unamortized discounts, as follows: June 30, 2009 - $686 thousand, December 31, 2008 - $689 thousand and June 30, 2008 - $692 thousand. The effective interest rate for these 30-year notes is 8.04%. The estimated fair values of long-term debt presented in the table above were determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on credit-adjusted interest rates on U.S. Treasury bills, notes or bonds, as appropriate. The fair value estimates were based on information available to management as of the respective balance sheet dates. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since those dates. Our debt agreements do not subject us to contractual restrictions with regard to working capital or the amount we may expend for cash dividends and purchases of our stock. The percentage of consolidated debt to total capitalization (total debt as a percentage of total capital), as defined in our bank credit facility agreements, must be less than 65%. Our total debt as a percentage of total capital was 42.8% as of June 30, 2009; 50.2% as of December 31, 2008; and 48.7% as of June 30, 2008. /*<![CDATA[*/ st1:*{behavior:url(#ieooui) } <!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; tab-stops:33.1pt 168.3pt 207.0pt 3.0in 4.5in 6.95in right 7.7in; font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; color:black;} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} /*]]>*/ "

Financing Transactions Revolving Credit Facility
and Term Loan—As of June 30, 2009, the Company had
$700.0 million outstanding under its $1.25 billion senior unsecured
revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) and had
approximately $4.7 million of undrawn letters of credit
outstanding. In March 2008, the Company increased its borrowing
capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility by adding $325.0
million of term loan commitments (Term Loan). As of June 30,
2009, the Term Loan was fully drawn. The Company continues to
maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the
Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 7.25% Senior Notes
Offering—On June 10, 2009, the Company completed an
institutional private placement of $300.0 million aggregate
principal amount of its 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019
(7.25% Notes). The net proceeds to the Company from the offering
were approximately $291.6 million, after deducting commissions and
expenses. The Company used $210.2 million of the net proceeds to
finance the repurchase of its outstanding 7.50% notes due 2012
(7.50% Notes) through a cash tender offer. In addition, the Company
used $50.0 million of the net proceeds to repay certain of its
outstanding indebtedness incurred under its Revolving Credit
Facility. The 7.25% Notes mature on
May 15, 2019, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears
on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing
November 15, 2009, to the persons in whose names the notes are
registered at the close of business on the preceding May 1 and
November 1, respectively. The Company may redeem the 7.25%
Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued
interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes will accrue
from June 10, 2009 and will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. If the Company undergoes a
change of control and ratings decline, each as defined in the
indenture for the 7.25% Notes, the Company may be required to
repurchase all of the 7.25% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101%
of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
and additional interest, if any, to but not including the date of
repurchase. The 7.25% Notes rank equally with all of the
Company’s other senior unsecured debt and are structurally
subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other
obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries. The indenture
contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s
ability to incur more subsidiary debt or permit subsidiaries to
provide guarantees; create liens; and merge, consolidate or sell
assets. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions,
including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur certain
indebtedness or liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing
indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such indebtedness and such
liens do not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the
indenture. Tender Offer for and
Redemption of 7.50% Senior Notes—During the six months
ended June 30, 2009, the Company repurchased an aggregate of
$204.2 million principal amount of the 7.50% Notes pursuant to a
cash tender offer. The Company paid $210.2 million, including
approximately $1.7 million in accrued and unpaid interest, to
holders of the 7.50% Notes using net proceeds from the
institutional private placement of the 7.25% Notes discussed above.
The Company recorded a charge of $6.0 million related to amounts
paid in excess of carrying value and the write-off of deferred
financing fees, which is reflected in loss on retirement of
long-term obligations in the accompanying condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2009. In June 2009, the Company issued a notice for
the redemption of the $20.8 million principal amount of its 7.50%
Notes that remained outstanding following the expiration of the
tender offer. (See note 13.) Stock Repurchase
Program—During the six months ended June 30, 2009,
the Company repurchased an aggregate of 2.3 million shares of
its Class A common stock (Common Stock) for an aggregate of
$69.6 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to its $1.5
billion stock repurchase program approved by the Company’s
Board of Directors in February 2008 (2008 Buyback). Between
July 1, 2009 and July 24, 2009, the Company repurchased
an additional 1.2 million shares of its Common Stock for an
aggregate of $38.2 million, including commissions and fees. As of
July 24, 2009, the Company had repurchased a total of
17.5 million shares of Common Stock for an aggregate of $641.2
million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008
Buyback. Under the 2008 Buyback, the
Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through
open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at
prevailing prices in accordance with securities laws and other
legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other
factors. To facilitate repurchases, the Company purchases its
Common Stock pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the
Exchange Act, which allows the Company to repurchase shares during
periods when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under
insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout
periods. In the near term, the Company expects to fund any further
repurchases of its Common Stock through a combination of cash on
hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under its
Revolving Credit Facility. Purchases under the 2008 Buyback are
subject to the Company having available cash to fund
repurchases. "

1,187,412 The Company has a $695 million five-year multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders. (This amount reflects the reduction of $55 million in availability under the facility as a result of the bankruptcy of Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. in September 2008). Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on the Company’s debt rating and ranges from 19 basis points to 60 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (40 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at June 30, 2009). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. The Company pays quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on the Company’s debt rating, ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points of the total commitment (10 basis points at June 30, 2009). The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales. In April 2009, the Company amended its receivables securitization facility (“Receivables Securitization Facility”), electing to reduce the amount available under the facility from $975 million to $700 million and extended the expiration date to April 2010. The Company continues to have available to it an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper plus a program fee. The Company pays a commitment fee to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The program fee and the commitment fee were 150 basis points and 75 basis points, respectively, at June 30, 2009. In April 2009, the Company amended the $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility (the “Blanco Credit Facility”) to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Blanco Credit Facility to April 2010. Borrowings under the Blanco Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company. In connection with the April 2009 amendment, interest on borrowings under this facility increased from 55 basis points over LIBOR to 200 basis points over LIBOR. Additionally, the Company is required to pay quarterly facility fees of 50 basis points on any unused portion of the facility. The Blanco Credit Facility is not classified in the current portion of long-term debt on the accompanying balance sheet at June 30, 2009 because the Company has both the ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis.

INDEBTEDNESS During the first quarter of 2009, we repaid $325 million principal amount of our 6.25% notes, which matured on January 15, 2009, and $200 million principal amount of our 6.00% notes, which matured on February 15, 2009. On March 30, 2009, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2009 Credit Agreement”) for a committed $500 million revolving credit facility that expires in March 2010. At June 30, 2009, we had $1.5 billion of credit facilities with commercial banks, of which $1.0 billion are committed revolving credit facilities, which includes the 2009 Credit Agreement. The committed facilities expire on July 7, 2012 ($500 million), unless extended, and on March 29, 2010 ($500 million). The $500 million facility that expires on July 7, 2012 provides for a one year extension, subject to the approval and acceptance by the lenders, among other conditions. In addition, this facility contains a provision to allow for an increase in the facility amount of an additional $500 million, subject to the approval and acceptance by the lenders, among other conditions. Both facilities contain certain covenants which, among other things, require the maintenance of a funded indebtedness to total capitalization ratio (a defined formula per each agreement), restrict certain merger transactions or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a significant subsidiary and limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the facilities may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the facilities, covenant defaults and other customary defaults. At June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of both committed credit facilities. There were no direct borrowings under the committed credit facilities during the quarter ended June 30, 2009. We also have an outstanding commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time up to $1.0 billion in commercial paper with maturity of no more than 270 days. To the extent we have outstanding commercial paper, our ability to borrow under the facilities is reduced. At June 30, 2009, we had no outstanding commercial paper. "

ective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP APB 14-1, which revises the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion. FSP APB 14-1 requires issuers of convertible debt instruments within its scope to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. FSP APB 14-1 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the issuer’s consolidated results of operations. The Company was required to apply this new standard to its 1.5% convertible debentures issued in 2004 and due in 2024 (1.5% Convertible Debentures) and its 2.5% convertible debentures issued in 2006 and due in 2026 (2.5
% Convertible Debentures). The bifurcation of the instruments was based on estimated market borrowing rates of 4.85% and 5.9%, respectively, for non-convertible debt instruments similar to the 1.5% and 2.5% Convertible Debentures. The discount assigned to the convertible debentures in order to result in interest expense equal to the nonconvertible debt borrowing rates mentioned above is being accreted to interest expense over an estimated five-year life of the convertible debentures. The estimated life is consistent with an option in the debentures allowing holders to require the Company to repurchase the debentures in whole or in part for principal plus accrued and unpaid interest fi
ve years following the date of issuance. Accordingly, as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1, interest expense for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 increased by $4,025,000 and $8,171,000, respectively. The Company has also retrospectively revised certain amounts included in these financial statements for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 Increase in interest expense $ 5,014 $ 10,

t;/td> 0.03 Approximately $65,802,000 has been included in capital in excess of par value on the Company’s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets at both June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 related to the conversion value of the Company’s 1.5% and 2.5% Con
vertible Debentures. On June 18, 2009, the Company notified the holders of its 1.5% Convertible Debentures that it would exercise its right to redeem for cash all of the outstanding notes on July 20, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including the redemption date. As of August 4, 2009, all of the 1.5% Convertible Debentures were either converted by the holders or redeemed by the Company. Approximately 3,156,818 shares of common stock were issued to holders of the 1.5% Convertible Debentures who elected the conversion option in recognition of the conversion value of those debentures thr
ough August 4, 2009. The carrying value of the 2.5% Convertible Debentures, totaling $469,628,000, has been classified as long-term debt in the June 30, 2009 Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as these debentures are not redeemable by holders until June 2011. At June 30, 2009, the conversion value of the 2.5% Convertible Debentures did not exceed the principal amount of the debentures. At June 30, 2009, the Company had borro
wings outstanding totaling £20,000,000, under its revolving credit facility at an interest rate of 0.97% with a maturity date of July 19, 2009. Other debt, totaling $35,898,000 at June 30, 2009 consists primarily of short-term borrowings at certain other international locations. At June 30, 2009, the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate debt (based on level 1 quoted market rates) was approximately $1,476,402,000 as compared to $1,381,104,000 principal amount of the debt. The carrying value of all other financial instruments are considered to be representative of their respective fair values. "

At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized premium of $2.2 million and $23.3 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $85.4 million and $88.0 million, respectively. The June 30, 2009 balance also includes an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to outstanding fair value hedges of $2.8 million. The face value of the Company's senior debt was $6.81 billion at June 30, 2009 and $6.79 billion at December 31, 2008. (b)
Included in ""Liabilities of discontinued operations"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The senior debt of CBS Corp. is fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary, CBS
Operations Inc. Senior debt in the amount of $52.2 million of the
Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Broadcasting Inc., is not
guaranteed. On May 13, 2009, CBS Corp.
issued $350.0 million of 8.875% senior notes due 2019 and
$400.0 million of 8.200% senior notes due 2014. On June 2, 2009, CBS
Corp. issued $250.0 million of 8.875% senior notes due 2019. Interest on
these senior notes will be paid semi-annually. The senior notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by CBS Operations Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of CBS Corp. During the six months ended
June 30, 2009, the Company repurchased $978.3 million of its 7.70%
senior notes due 2010 resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of
$29.8 million. Credit Facility At June 30, 2009, the Company
had a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in December 2010
(the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a
minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, of 3x
for the trailing four quarters. At June 30, 2009, the Company's
Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 4x. The primary purpose of the
Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings. At June 30,
2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and
the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters
of credit, was $2.80 billion. Accounts Receivable
Securitization Program The Company's revolving accounts
receivable securitization program provides for the sale of receivables on a
non-recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one-year renewable basis,
thereby reducing accounts receivable on the Company's Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The Company entered into this arrangement because it provides an
additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from this program were used to reduce
outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving securitization arrangement
require that the receivable pools subject to the program meet certain
performance ratios. As of June 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with
the required ratios under the receivable securitization program. During the six
months ended June 30, 2009, the Company reduced amounts outstanding under
its accounts receivable securitization program by $300.0 million to
$250.0 million at June 30, 2009 from $550.0 million at
December 31, 2008. During the six months ended
June 30, 2009 and 2008, proceeds from collections of securitized accounts
receivables of $609.9 million and $1.43 billion, respectively, were
reinvested in the revolving receivable securitization program. The net loss
associated with securitizing the program's accounts receivables was
$.7 million and $1.3 million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2009, respectively, and $3.5 million and $7.7 million
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008,
respectively.

At June 30, 2009, Cooper has U.S. committed credit facilities that total $513 million, of which $13 million matures in September 2009 and $500 million matures in November 2009. Cooper is currently negotiating a new $350 million committed credit facility with a term of three years and anticipates the new facility to be in place in August 2009. However, there can be no assurance that a new facility will be negotiated in that time, or at all, and it is likely that the terms of the new facility will not be as attractive as in the existing facility that expires in November 2009.

The initial exchange rate is 8.5051 shares per $1,000 principal
amount of the notes (or an initial exchange price of approximately
$117.58 per share of Boston Properties, Inc.’s Common Stock).
In addition, we entered into capped call transactions with
affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, which are intended
to reduce the potential dilution upon future exchange of the notes.
The capped call transactions are expected to have the effect of
increasing the effective exchange price to us of the notes from
$117.58 to approximately $137.17 per share, representing an overall
effective premium of approximately 40% over the closing price on
August 13, 2008 of $97.98 per share of Boston Properties,
Inc.’s Common Stock. The net cost of the capped call
transactions was approximately $44.4 million. (3)
In connection with the special distribution of $5.98 per share
of Boston Properties, Inc.’s Common Stock declared on
December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was adjusted from 6.6090
to 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as
of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of
approximately $141.98 per share of Boston Properties, Inc.’s
Common Stock. (4)
In connection with the special distribution of $5.98 per share
of Boston Properties, Inc.’s Common Stock declared on
December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was adjusted from 9.3900
to 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as
of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of
approximately $99.93 per share of Boston Properties, Inc.’s
Common Stock. FSP No. APB 14-1 requires the
liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments
that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash
settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that
reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. FSP
No. APB 14-1 requires that the initial proceeds from the sale of
the Operating Partnership’s $862.5 million of 2.875%
exchangeable senior notes due 2037, $450.0 million of 3.75%
exchangeable senior notes due 2036 and $747.5 million of 3.625%
exchangeable senior notes due 2014 be allocated between a liability
component and an equity component in a manner that reflects
interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible
debt. The Company measured the fair value of the debt components of
the 2.875%, 3.75% and 3.625% exchangeable senior notes for the
periods presented based on effective interest rates of 5.630%,
5.958% and 6.555%, respectively. The aggregate carrying amount of
the debt component was approximately $1.88 billion and $1.86
billion (net of the FSP No. 14-1 adjustment of approximately
$160.1 million and $179.0 million) at June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. As a result, the Company
attributed an aggregate of approximately $230.3 million of the
proceeds to the equity component of the notes, which represents the
excess proceeds received over the fair value of the notes at the
date of issuance. The equity component of the notes has been
reflected within Additional Paid-in Capital in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The Company reclassified approximately $1.0 million
of deferred financing costs to Additional Paid-in Capital, which
represented the costs attributable to the equity components of the
notes. The carrying amount of the equity component was
approximately $229.3 million at June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008. The resulting debt discount will be
amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be
outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption dates or,
in the case of the 2014 notes, the maturity date) as additional
non-cash interest expense. The additional non-cash interest expense
will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the first
optional redemption dates (or, in the case of the 2014 notes, the
maturity date) as the debt accretes to its par value over the same
period. The aggregate contractual interest expense was
approximately $18.6 million and $11.5 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and approximately
$37.1 million and $22.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result of applying
FSP No. APB 14-1, the Company reported additional non-cash interest
expense of approximately $9.5 million and $5.6 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
approximately $18.9 million and $11.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. FSP No. APB 14-1
requires companies to retrospectively apply the requirements of the
pronouncement to all periods presented. As a result, the revised
diluted earnings per share was reduced by $0.04 and $0.07 for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2008,
respectively. "

The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of June 30, 2009 is as follows: Payments due by Period (in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Term loan $

6,275 Note: The table above does not include discounts associated with our Abbott loan and senior notes, or amounts related to certain interest rate swaps that were used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes. In July 2009, we made a prepayment of $225 million towards our term loan. As a result, our next debt maturity is $100 million due in April 2010. In February 2009, we amended our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement to increase flexibility under our financial covenants. The amendment provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the amended agreement, through the credit agreement maturity in April 2011, of up to $346 million in restructuring charges to support our Plant Network Optimization and other expense reduction initiatives, described in Note F - Restructuring-related Activities; an exclusion for any litigation-related charges and credits until such items are paid or received; and an exclusion of up to $1.137 billion of any cash payments for litigation settlements or damage awards (net of any litigation payments received), and all cash payments (net of cash receipts) related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements before January 1, 2009. At the same time, we prepaid $500 million of our term loan. In addition, the agreement provides for an increase in interest rates on our term loan borrowings from LIBOR plus 1.00 percent to LIBOR plus 1.75 percent at current credit ratings. Further, the interest rate on unused facilities increased from 0.175 percent to 0.500 percent. In connection with the amendment of our term loan and revolving credit facility, we reduced availability under our credit facility by $250 million to $1.750 billion. Further reducing our borrowing capacity, in 2008, we issued a $717 million surety bond backed by a $702 million letter of credit and $15 million of cash to secure a damage award related to the Johnson & Johnson patent infringement case pending appeal, described in Note L — Commitments and Contingencies. We also maintain a $350 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. Use of the borrowings is unrestricted. Borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of eligible receivables, concentration of eligible receivables and other factors. During the third quarter of 2009, we extended the maturity of this facility to August 2010. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of June 30, 2009 or December 31, 2008. Further, we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 18.5 billion Japanese yen (translated to approximately $192 million as of June 30, 2009 and $205 million as of December 31, 2008). We discounted notes receivable of $188 million as of June 30, 2009 and $190 million as of December 31, 2008. Discounted notes receivable are excluded from accounts receivable in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows: Covenant Actual as of Requirement June 30, 2009 Maximum leverage ratio (1) 4.0 to 1.0 2.9 to 1.0 Minimum interest coverage ratio (2) 3.0 to 1.0 5.2 to 1.0 (1) Ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as amended, for the preceding four fiscal quarters. The maximum permitted leverage ratio steps down to 3.5 to 1.0 on September 30, 2009. (2) Ratio of EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as amended, to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Our inability to maintain these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers. "

The Company received net proceeds of $971,537 from this transaction, which represents the principal amount less the discount. The discount of $3,463 is being amortized over the life of the Senior Notes and is included as part of interest expense on the statement of operations. The interest expense incurred related to the Senior Notes was $15,047 for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $30,094 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was $22,570 of accrued interest at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company made interest payments of $30,094 on February 15, 2009 and February 15, 2008. In March 2004, the Company established a $500,000 commercial paper program, which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. This program is backed up by a $500,000 senior revolving credit facility. There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at June 30, 2009. The Company did not use the revolving credit facility during the six months ended June 30, 2009 or the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and no amounts are currently outstanding. The $500,000 senior revolving credit facility contains a $30,000 commitment from Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (“Lehman”). Based on the financial condition of Lehman, the Company is not relying on Lehman’s commitment. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that the Company maintain certain specified minimum ratios and thresholds. Among others, these covenants include maintaining a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and a minimum consolidated adjusted net worth. As of June 30, 2009 the Company was in compliance with all covenants, minimum ratios and thresholds. /*<![CDATA[*/ <!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:""Cambria Math""; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman"",""serif""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} p {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-margin-top-alt:auto; margin-right:0in; mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; margin-left:0in; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman"",""serif""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} .MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-size:10.0pt; mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman"",""serif"";} /*]]>*/ "

Credit
Facilities
PHI’s principal credit source is
an unsecured $1.5 billion syndicated credit facility, which can be
used by PHI and its utility subsidiaries to borrow funds, obtain
letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper.
This facility is in effect until May 2012 and consists of
commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is responsible for
more than 8.5% of the total $1.5 billion commitment. PHI’s
credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit
of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the lesser of $500 million and the
maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding
by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of
credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively
may not exceed $625 million.
In November 2008, PHI entered into a
second unsecured credit facility in the amount of $400 million with
a syndicate of nine lenders. Under the facility, PHI may
obtain revolving loans and swingline loans over the term of the
facility, which expires on November 6, 2009. The facility does
not provide for the issuance of letters of credit. These two
facilities are referred to collectively as PHI’s
“primary credit facilities.”
PHI and its utility subsidiaries
historically have issued commercial paper to meet their short-term
working capital requirements. As a result of the disruptions
in the commercial paper market in 2008, the companies borrowed
under the $1.5 billion credit facility to create a cash reserve for
future short-term operating needs. At June 30, 2009, PHI
had an outstanding loan of $150 million and DPL had an outstanding
loan of $50 million under the credit facility. DPL repaid its loan
in July 2009.
At June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity
under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to meet the
future liquidity needs of PHI on a consolidated basis totaled $1.5
billion, of which the combined cash and borrowing capacity under
the $1.5 billion credit facility of PHI’s utility
subsidiaries was $549 million and $843 million,
respectively.
Other Financing
Activities
During the three months ended
June 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred: • In
April 2009, Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE
Funding) made principal payments of $5.3 million on Series 2002-1
Bonds, Class A-2, and $2.1 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds,
Class A-1. • In April
2009, Pepco repaid, prior to maturity, a $25 million short-term
loan. • In April
2009, DPL resold $9 million of its Pollution Control Revenue
Refunding Bonds, which previously had been issued for the benefit
of DPL by the Delaware Economic Development Authority. These bonds
were repurchased by DPL in November 2008 in response to disruption
in the tax-exempt bond market that made it difficult for the
remarketing agent to successfully remarket the bonds. As the owner
of the bonds, DPL received the proceeds of the sale, which it
intends to use for general corporate purposes. • In April
2009, PHI and its utility subsidiaries entered into a $25 million
line of credit that can be used by these entities for equipment
leasing through February 2010. As of June 30, 2009, $7 million
of this line of credit has been utilized. • In May 2009,
DPL repaid, prior to maturity, $50 million of a $150 million
short-term loan, which matured in July 2009. • In May 2009,
PHI entered into a $50 million, 18-month bi-lateral credit
agreement, which can only be used for the purpose of obtaining
letters of credit. • In
June 2009, ACE completed the remarketing of approximately $23
million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds which
previously had been issued for the benefit of ACE by The Pollution
Control Financing Authority of Salem County, New Jersey. The bonds
were purchased during late 2008 and early 2009 by the Bank of New
York Mellon pursuant to a standby bond purchase agreement in
response to disruption in the municipal variable rate demand bond
market that made it difficult for the remarketing agent to
successfully remarket the bonds. The proceeds of the remarketing
were used to reimburse the Bank of New York Mellon. Subsequent to June 30, 2009, the
following financing activities occurred:
In July 2009, ACE Funding made
principal payments of $5.2 million on Series 2002-1 Bonds,
Class A-2, $1.4 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds,
Class A-1, and $0.7 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds,
Class A-2.
In July 2009, DPL repaid, at maturity,
the remaining $100 million of its original $150 million short-term
loan.
In July 2009, PHI’s utility
subsidiaries entered into a $30 million line of credit that can be
used by these entities for equipment leasing through July
2010.
In July 2009, DPL redeemed the $15
million Series 2003 A and $18.2 million Series 2003 B Delaware
Economic Development Authority tax exempt bonds that were
repurchased in 2008 due to the disruptions in the tax exempt
capital markets.
In July 2009, ACE redeemed the $25
million Series 2004 A and $6.5 million Series 2004 B Pollution
Control Financing Authority of Cape May County tax exempt bonds
that were repurchased in 2008 due to the disruptions in the tax
exempt capital markets.
Collateral Requirements of the
Competitive Energy Business
In conducting its retail energy supply
business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of declining energy
prices, has been exposed to the asymmetrical risk of having to post
collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts without receiving
a corresponding amount of collateral from its retail customers. To
partially address these asymmetrical collateral obligations, Pepco
Energy Services, in the first quarter of 2009, entered into a
credit intermediation arrangement with Morgan Stanley Capital
Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement, MSCG, in consideration
for the payment to MSCG of certain fees, (i) has assumed by
novation certain electricity purchase obligations of Pepco Energy
Services in years 2009 through 2011 under several wholesale
purchase contracts and (ii) has agreed to supply electricity
to Pepco Energy Services on the same terms as the novated
transactions, but without imposing on Pepco Energy Services any
associated collateral obligations. As of June 30, 2009,
approximately 32% of Pepco Energy Services’ wholesale
electricity purchase obligations (measured in megawatt hours) were
covered by this credit intermediation arrangement with
MSCG. The fees incurred by Pepco Energy Services in the amount
of $25 million are being amortized into expense in declining
amounts over the life of the arrangement based on the fair value of
the underlying contracts at the time of novation. For the three and
six months ended June 30, 2009, approximately $7 million and
$8 million, respectively, of the fees have been
amortized. In addition to Pepco Energy
Service’s retail energy supply business, Conectiv Energy and
Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business enter into
various other contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and
related products, including derivative instruments, designed to
reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their
assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These
contracts also typically have collateral requirements.
Depending on the contract terms, the
collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy Services and
Conectiv Energy can be of varying forms, including cash and letters
of credit. As of June 30, 2009, the Competitive Energy
business (including Pepco Energy Service’s retail energy
supply business) had posted net cash collateral of $443 million and
letters of credit of $182 million. At December 31, 2008, the
Competitive Energy business had posted net cash collateral of $331
million and letters of credit of $558 million.
At June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity
under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to meet the
future liquidity needs of the Competitive Energy business totaled
$915 million and $684 million, respectively. "

The net proceeds received of $1.187 billion, after discounts and issuance costs, were used primarily to repay Devon's $1.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2008. Credit Lines Devon has two syndicated, unsecured revolving lines of credit that can be accessed to provide liquidity as needed. The following schedule summarizes the capacity of Devon's credit facilities by maturity date, as well as its available capacity as of June 30, 2009. Description Amount (In millions) Senior Credit Facility maturities: April 7, 2012....................................................................................................... $ 500 April 7, 2013....................................................................................................... 2,150 Senior Credit Facility total capacity................................................................ 2,650 Short-Term Facility total capacity – November 3, 2009 maturity............ 700 Total credit facility capacity............................................................................. 3,350 Less: Outstanding credit facility borrowings........................................................... — Outstanding commercial paper borrowings.................................................. 1,330 Outstanding letters of credit............................................................................ 111 Total available capacity.................................................................................... $ 1,909 The credit facilities contain only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon’s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65%. The credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Also, total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of June 30, 2009, Devon was in compliance with this covenant. Devon’s debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2009, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 21.8%. Commercial Paper Subsequent to the $1.0 billion commercial paper repayment in January 2009, Devon utilized additional commercial paper borrowings of $1.3 billion to fund capital expenditure payments in excess of cash generated by operating activities during the first half of 2009. As of June 30, 2009, Devon’s average borrowing rate on its $1.3 billion of commercial paper debt was 0.48%. /*<![CDATA[*/ st1:*{behavior:url(#ieooui) } <!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:""Cambria Math""; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman"",""serif""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} .MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-size:10.0pt; mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman"",""serif"";} table.MsoTableGrid {mso-style-name:""Table Grid""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-unhide:no; border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-border-insideh:.5pt solid windowtext; mso-border-insidev:.5pt solid windowtext; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman"",""serif"";} /*]]>*/ "

(a) Credit Agreement In connection with its
acquisition of Third Wave, on July 17, 2008 the Company
entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the
“Amended Credit Agreement”) with Goldman Sachs Credit
Partners L.P. and certain other lenders (collectively, the
“Lenders”). The Amended Credit Agreement amended and
restated the Company’s existing credit agreement with the
Lenders, dated as of October 22, 2007. Pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement, the Lenders committed
to provide senior secured financing in an aggregate amount of up to
$800,000. The credit facility consisted of a $400,000 senior
secured tranche A term loan (“Term Loan A”); a $200,000
senior secured tranche B term loan (“Term Loan B”); and
a $200,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the
“Revolving Facility”). In order to complete the
acquisition of Third Wave, the Company borrowed $540,000 under the
credit facilities on July 17, 2008, consisting of $400,000
under the Term Loan A and $140,000 under the Term Loan B. As of
June 27, 2009, the Company had an aggregate of $269,693 of
principal outstanding under this credit facility of which $194,419
was under the Term Loan A and $75,274 was under the Term Loan B.
The long-term portion of the Term Loan A and Term Loan B loans were
$173,401 and $74,187, respectively, at June 27, 2009.
Subsequent to June 27, 2009, the Company paid down
approximately $56,000 of the outstanding principal. The Company had
no amounts outstanding under its Revolving Facility, and therefore,
had full availability of the $200,000 Revolving Facility as of
June 27, 2009. The final maturity dates for the credit
facility are September 30, 2012 for the Term Loan A and
Revolving Facility and March 31, 2013 for the Term Loan
B. The domestic subsidiaries of
the Company which are party to the Amended Credit Agreement
(including Third Wave, which joined as a party to the Amended
Credit Agreement on July 24, 2008) have guaranteed the
Company’s obligations under the credit facilities and the
credit facilities are secured by first-priority liens on, and
first-priority security interests in, substantially all of the
assets of the Company and all subsidiaries party to the Amended
Credit Agreement, a first priority security interest in 100% of the
capital stock issued by each guarantor, 65% of the capital stock
issued by certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries of the Company
and all intercompany debt. The security interests are evidenced by
an Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement by and among
Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., as collateral agent, Hologic
and the other parties therein named (the “Amended Pledge and
Security Agreement”). The Amended Pledge and Security
Agreement amended and restated Hologic’s existing Pledge and
Security Agreement by and among Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P.,
as collateral agent, Hologic and the other parties therein named,
dated as of October 22, 2007. All amounts outstanding under
the amended credit facilities bear interest, at Hologic’s
option, as follows: With respect to loans made
under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan A
facility: (i)
at the Base Rate plus 1.25% per annum, which
was reduced from 1.50% in May 2009; or (ii)
at the reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus
2.25% per annum, which was reduced from 2.50% in May 2009;
and With respect to loans made
under the Term Loan B facility: (i)
at the Base Rate plus 2.25% per annum;
or (ii)
at the reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus
3.25% per annum. The margin applicable to
loans under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan A is subject
to specified changes based on certain changes in the leverage ratio
as specified in the Amended Credit Agreement. Interest accruing at the base
rate generally is payable by the Company on a quarterly basis.
Interest accruing at the Eurodollar Rate is payable on the last day
of selected interest periods (which shall be one, two, three and
six months and in certain circumstances, nine or twelve months)
unless the interest period exceeds three months, in which case,
interest will be due at the end of every three months. Borrowings outstanding under
the Amended Credit Agreement during the three and nine months ended
June 27, 2009 had a weighted average interest rate of 2.77%
and 3.97%, respectively. At June 27, 2009, the interest rates
on the outstanding Term Loan A borrowings ranged from 2.625% to
4.5% and on the Term Loan B borrowings ranged from 3.625% to 5.5%.
Interest expense under the Amended Credit agreement for the term
loans totaled $6,507 and $18,813 during the three and nine months
ending June 27, 2009, respectively, which included non-cash
interest expense of $3,973 and $7,229, respectively, related to the
amortization of the capitalized deferred financing costs related to
this facility. As of June 27, 2009, there was $9,903 in
deferred financing costs related to the Term Loans classified as
Other Assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Interest expense under the
Amended Credit Agreement for the Revolving Facility totaled $467
and $1,451 during the three and nine months ended June 27,
2009, respectively, consisting of commitment fees on the unused
portion of this facility and non-cash interest expense of $247 and
$734 related to the amortization of capitalized deferred financing
costs. As of June 27, 2009, there was $3,221 in deferred
financing costs related to the Revolving Facility classified as
Other Assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company pays a quarterly commitment fee, at a per annum rate of
0.375%, which was reduced from 0.50% in May 2009, on the undrawn
commitments available under the Revolving Facility, which per annum
rate is subject to reduction based on a leverage ratio as specified
in the Amended Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the original
credit agreement from initial drawdown at October 22, 2007
through June 28, 2008 had a weighted average interest rate of
4.96%. Interest expense under these credit facilities totaled
approximately $3,500 and $40,400 during the three and nine months
ended June 28, 2008, respectively, which included non-cash
interest expense of approximately $2,200 and $12,100 related to the
amortization of the capitalized deferred financing
costs. The credit facilities contain
affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior
secured credit facilities, including financial covenants which
require the Company to maintain maximum leverage and minimum
interest coverage ratios, as of the last day of each fiscal
quarter. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of
June 27, 2009.
(b) Convertible Notes On December 10, 2007,
the Company issued and sold $1,725,000 aggregate original principal
amount of 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (the
“Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes were
registered under an effective Registration Statement and were
issued pursuant to an Indenture between the Company and Wilmington
Trust Company, as Trustee (the “Indenture”) and a First
Supplemental Indenture thereto (the “Supplemental
Indenture”), both dated December 10, 2007. Holders may require the
Company to repurchase the Convertible Notes on December 13 of
2013, and each of December 15, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032 at a
repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may redeem any of the
Convertible Notes beginning December 18, 2013, by giving
holders at least 30 days’ notice. The Company may redeem the
Convertible Notes either in whole or in part at a redemption price
equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, including contingent interest and liquidated damages, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Interest expense under the
Convertible Notes totaled $9,727 and $30,171 during the three and
nine months ended June 27, 2009, respectively, which included
non-cash interest expense of $1,501 and $4,503, respectively,
related to the amortization of the capitalized deferred financing
costs related to the Convertible Notes Agreement. Interest expense
under the Convertible Notes totaled $9,935 and $22,249 during the
three and nine months ended June 28, 2008, respectively, which
included non-cash interest expense of $1,502 and $3,275,
respectively, related to the amortization of the capitalized
deferred financing costs related to the Convertible Notes
Agreement. As of June 27, 2009, there was $26,748 in deferred
financing costs related to the Convertible Notes classified as
Other Assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The Convertible Notes bear
interest at a rate of 2.00% per year on the principal amount,
payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on June 15 and
December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2008 and
ending on December 15, 2013. The Convertible Notes will
accrete principal from December 15, 2013 at a rate that
provides holders with an aggregate annual yield to maturity of
2.00% per year. Beginning with the six month interest period
commencing December 15, 2013, the Company will pay contingent
interest during any six month interest period to the holders of
Convertible Notes if the “trading price”, as defined,
of the Convertible Notes for each of the five trading days ending
on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of
the applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of
the accreted principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The holders of the
Convertible Notes may convert the notes into shares of the
Company’s common stock at a conversion price of approximately
$38.60 per share, subject to adjustment, prior to the close of
business on September 15, 2037, subject to prior redemption or
repurchase of the notes, upon the occurrence of certain events, as
defined. None of the events that would allow the holders to convert
prior to September 15, 2037 have occurred to date. In lieu of delivery of shares
of the Company’s common stock in satisfaction of the
Company’s obligation upon conversion of the Convertible
Notes, the Company may elect to deliver cash or a combination of
cash and shares of the Company’s common stock. If
the Company elects to satisfy
its conversion obligation in a combination of cash and shares of
the Company’s common stock, the Company is required to
deliver up to a specified dollar amount of cash per $1,000 original
principal amount of Convertible Notes, and will settle the
remainder of the conversion obligation in shares of its common
stock, in each case as provided in the Indenture. It is the
Company’s current intent and policy to settle any conversion
of the Convertible Notes as if the Company had elected to make the
net share settlement election. The Convertible Notes are the
Company’s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with
all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured
debt and prior to all future subordinated debt. The Convertible
Notes are effectively subordinated to any future secured
indebtedness to the extent of the collateral securing such
indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and
other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s
subsidiaries. If an event of default, as
defined, relates to the Company’s failure to comply with the
reporting obligations in the Convertible Notes, if the Company so
elects, the sole remedy of the holders of the Convertible Notes for
the first 90 days following such event of default consists
exclusively of the right to receive an extension fee on the notes
in an amount equal to 0.25% of the accreted principal amount of the
Convertible Notes. Based on the Company’s
evaluation of the Convertible Notes in accordance with EITF Issue
No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock, and SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities (“SFAS 133”),
the Company determined that the Convertible Notes contained a
single embedded derivative, comprising both the contingent interest
feature and the filing failure penalty payment requiring
bifurcation as the features were not clearly and closely related to
the host instrument. The Company has determined that the value of
this embedded derivative was nominal for all periods presented in
the consolidated financial statements. As of June 27, 2009,
upon conversion, including the potential premium that could be
payable on a fundamental change (as defined), the Company would
issue a maximum of approximately 56,000 common shares to the
Convertible Note holders. See Note 19, “Recent
Accounting Pronouncements”, for a discussion related to the
impact of the adoption of FASB Staff Position Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt
Instruments that May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including
Partial Cash Settlement) in fiscal 2010.
(c) AEG Debt The Company’s AEG
subsidiary has approximately $9,000 outstanding at June 27,
2009 under certain debt agreements of which the long term portion
is approximately $7,100. The terms of the agreements have various
maturities ranging from December 30, 2010 through
March 30, 2014. Outstanding borrowings had interest rates
ranging from 2.1% to 4.3% and 5.5% to 7.2% during the nine months
ended June 27, 2009 and June 28, 2008, respectively.
Interest expense incurred under these debt agreements totaled $75
and $314 during the three and nine months ended June 27, 2009,
respectively, and $174 and $572 during the three and nine months
ended June 28, 2008, respectively. Subsequent to June 27,
2009, the Company paid off approximately $7,200 of the outstanding
principal balance under these debt agreements. "

div style=""DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt""> Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationships Enterprise Products Partners L.P. acts as guarantor of the consolidated debt obligations of EPO with the exception of the DEP Revolving Credit Facility and the DEP Term Loan. If EPO were to default on any of its guaranteed debt, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. would be responsible for full repayment of that obligation. Letters of Credit At June 30, 2009, EPO had outstanding a $60.0 million letter of credit relating to its commodity derivative instruments and a $50.7 million letter of credit related to its Petal GO Zone Bonds. These letter of credit facilities do not reduce the amount available for borrowing under EPO’s credit facilities. In addition, Duncan Energy Partners had an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of $1.0 million at June 30, 2009, which does reduce the amount available for borrowing under its credit facility. EPO’s Debt Obligations Apart from that discussed below, there have been no significant changes in the terms of our debt obligations since those reported in our Recast Form 8-K. &
lt;/div> $200.0 Million Term Loan. In April 2009, EPO entered into a $200.0 Million Term Loan, which was subsequently repaid and terminated in June 2009 using funds from the issuance of Senior Notes P. 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility. I
n November 2008, EPO executed a standby 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the “364-Day Facility”) that had a borrowing capacity of $375.0 million. The 364-Day Facility was terminated in June 2009 under its terms as a result of the issuance of Senior Notes P. No amounts were borrowed under this standby facility through its termination date. Senior Notes P. In June 2009, EPO sold $500.0 million in principal amount of 3-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes P&a
mp;#8221;). Senior Notes P were issued at 99.95% of their principal amount, have a fixed interest rate of 4.60% and mature on August 1, 2012. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes P were used (i) to repay amounts borrowed under the $200 Million Term Loan, (ii) to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) for general partnership purposes. Senior Notes P rank equal with EPO’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. They are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO. Senior Notes P are subject to make-whole redemptio
n rights and were issued under indentures containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO’s ability, with certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Dixie Revolving Credit Facility The Dixie Revolving Credit Facility was terminated in January 2009. 160;As of December 31, 2008, there were no debt obligations outstanding under this facility.

2,350.4 Senior Unsecured Bridge Loan
Facility
In connection with the Trane
acquisition, the Company entered into a $3.9 billion senior
unsecured bridge loan facility, with a 364-day term. The Company
drew down $2.95 billion against the bridge loan facility in June
2008. The proceeds, along with cash on hand and the issuance of
$1.5 billion in commercial paper, were used to fund the cash
component of the consideration paid for the acquisition as well as
to pay for related fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the acquisition.
At December 31, 2008, the
outstanding balance of the senior unsecured bridge loan facility
was $754.0 million, which would have expired in June 2009 per
the original term. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company
borrowed an additional $196.0 million under the facility increasing
the outstanding balance to $950.0 million as of March 31,
2009. In April 2009, we repaid the outstanding balance with our
long-term debt issuance described below and terminated the
facility.
Debentures with Put
Feature
The Company has fixed rate debentures
which contain a put feature that allows the holders to exercise on
each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, the Company is
obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder’s
option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid
interest) of the debentures held by the holder. If these options
are not fully exercised, the final maturity dates would range
between 2027 and 2028.
In February 2009, holders of these
debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on $39.2
million of the outstanding debentures, of which approximately $2.0
million were exercised and repaid in February. In the fourth
quarter of 2009, holders of these debentures will have the option
to exercise the put feature on approximately $306.5 million of the
remaining debentures. Long-term debt excluding current

debt was $4,784.2 million at June 30, 2009. The fair value of
debt was primarily based upon quoted market values.
Senior Notes Due 2014
In April 2009, the Company issued $655
million of 9.5% Senior Notes through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global). The
notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited.
Interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year in
arrears. The Company has the option to redeem them in whole or in
part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated
maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture
agreement. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants,
however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to the
Company’s operations.
Exchangeable Senior Notes Due
2012
In April 2009, the Company issued $345
million of 4.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, IR-Global. The notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by IR-Limited. Interest on the exchangeable notes will
be paid twice a year in arrears. Holders may exchange their notes
at their option prior to November 15, 2011 in accordance with
specified circumstances set forth in the indenture agreement or
anytime on or after November 15, 2011 through their scheduled
maturity in April 2012. Upon exchange, the notes will be paid in
cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be
exchanged, the remainder due on the option feature, if any, will be
paid in cash, the Company’s common stock or a combination
thereof at the option of the Company. The notes are subject to
certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are
considered restrictive to the Company’s
operations.
The Company accounts for the
exchangeable notes in accordance with FASB Staff Position (FSP) APB
14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May
be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
Settlements),” which requires the Company to allocate the
proceeds between debt and equity, in a manner that reflects the
Company’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The Company
allocated approximately $305 million of the gross proceeds to debt,
with the remaining discount of approximately $40 million
(approximately $39 million after allocated fees) recorded within
equity. Additionally, the Company will amortize the discount into
earnings over a three-year period, in accordance with this
FSP. Credit Facilities
At December 31, 2008, the
Company’s committed revolving credit facilities totaled $3.0
billion, of which $750 million expired in June 2009, and was not
renewed. At June 30, 2009, the Company’s committed
revolving credit facilities totaled $2.25 billion, of which $1.25
billion expires in August 2010 and $1.0 billion expires in June
2011. These lines are unused and provide support for the
Company’s commercial paper program as well as for other
general corporate purposes.
Modifications Relating to the
Reorganization
In connection with the Reorganization
discussed in Note 2, on July 1, 2009 at 12:01 A.M. (the
Transaction Time), IR-Limited completed the transfer of all the
outstanding shares of IR-Global to Ingersoll-Rand International
Holding Limited (IR-International), another wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in Bermuda, whereupon
IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as an issuer
or guarantor, as the case may be, under the indentures governing
the Company’s outstanding notes, medium-term notes and
debentures. IR-Ireland and IR-Limited also fully and
unconditionally guarantee the payment obligations of
IR-International, IR-Global and Ingersoll-Rand Company (IR-New
Jersey), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited
incorporated in New Jersey, as the case may be, as the issuers of
debt securities under these indentures. Neither IR-Ireland nor
IR-Limited intends to issue guarantees in respect of any
indebtedness incurred by Trane. In addition, any securities issued
by the Company that were convertible, exchangeable or exercisable
into Class A common shares of IR-Limited became convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable, as the case may be, into the ordinary
shares of IR-Ireland.
On July 1, 2009, IR-Global amended
and restated its commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper
Program) pursuant to which IR-Global may issue, on a private
placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum
aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.25 billion. Under
the Commercial Paper Program, IR-Global may issue notes from time
to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general
corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and
IR-International has provided an irrevocable and unconditional
guarantee for the notes issued under the Commercial Paper
Program.
Pursuant to the terms of the credit
facility entered into on August 12, 2005 and our credit
facility entered into on June 27, 2008 (the Credit
Facilities), at the Transaction Time, IR-Ireland and
IR-International became guarantors to such Credit Facilities. In
connection therewith, IR-Ireland and IR-International entered into
Addendums on July 1, 2009 to become parties to the Credit
Facilities. "

Credit
Facilities
PHI’s principal credit source is
an unsecured $1.5 billion syndicated credit facility, which can be
used by PHI and its utility subsidiaries to borrow funds, obtain
letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper.
This facility is in effect until May 2012 and consists of
commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is responsible for
more than 8.5% of the total $1.5 billion commitment. PHI’s
credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit
of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the lesser of $500 million and the
maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding
by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of
credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively
may not exceed $625 million.
In November 2008, PHI entered into a
second unsecured credit facility in the amount of $400 million with
a syndicate of nine lenders. Under the facility, PHI may
obtain revolving loans and swingline loans over the term of the
facility, which expires on November 6, 2009. The facility does
not provide for the issuance of letters of credit. These two
facilities are referred to collectively as PHI’s
“primary credit facilities.”
PHI and its utility subsidiaries
historically have issued commercial paper to meet their short-term
working capital requirements. As a result of the disruptions
in the commercial paper market in 2008, the companies borrowed
under the $1.5 billion credit facility to create a cash reserve for
future short-term operating needs. At June 30, 2009, PHI
had an outstanding loan of $150 million and DPL had an outstanding
loan of $50 million under the credit facility. DPL repaid its loan
in July 2009.
At June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity
under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to meet the
future liquidity needs of PHI on a consolidated basis totaled $1.5
billion, of which the combined cash and borrowing capacity under
the $1.5 billion credit facility of PHI’s utility
subsidiaries was $549 million and $843 million,
respectively.
Other Financing
Activities
During the three months ended
June 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred: • In
April 2009, Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE
Funding) made principal payments of $5.3 million on Series 2002-1
Bonds, Class A-2, and $2.1 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds,
Class A-1. • In April
2009, Pepco repaid, prior to maturity, a $25 million short-term
loan. • In April
2009, DPL resold $9 million of its Pollution Control Revenue
Refunding Bonds, which previously had been issued for the benefit
of DPL by the Delaware Economic Development Authority. These bonds
were repurchased by DPL in November 2008 in response to disruption
in the tax-exempt bond market that made it difficult for the
remarketing agent to successfully remarket the bonds. As the owner
of the bonds, DPL received the proceeds of the sale, which it
intends to use for general corporate purposes. • In April
2009, PHI and its utility subsidiaries entered into a $25 million
line of credit that can be used by these entities for equipment
leasing through February 2010. As of June 30, 2009, $7 million
of this line of credit has been utilized. • In May 2009,
DPL repaid, prior to maturity, $50 million of a $150 million
short-term loan, which matured in July 2009. • In May 2009,

agreement, which can only be used for the purpose of obtaining
letters of credit. • In
June 2009, ACE completed the remarketing of approximately $23
million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds which
previously had been issued for the benefit of ACE by The Pollution
Control Financing Authority of Salem County, New Jersey. The bonds
were purchased during late 2008 and early 2009 by the Bank of New
York Mellon pursuant to a standby bond purchase agreement in
response to disruption in the municipal variable rate demand bond
market that made it difficult for the remarketing agent to
successfully remarket the bonds. The proceeds of the remarketing
were used to reimburse the Bank of New York Mellon. Subsequent to June 30, 2009, the
following financing activities occurred:
In July 2009, ACE Funding made
principal payments of $5.2 million on Series 2002-1 Bonds,

million Series 2003 A and $18.2 million Series 2003 B Delaware
Economic Development Authority tax exempt bonds that were
repurchased in 2008 due to the disruptions in the tax exempt
capital markets.
In July 2009, ACE redeemed the $25
million Series 2004 A and $6.5 million Series 2004 B Pollution
Control Financing Authority of Cape May County tax exempt bonds
that were repurchased in 2008 due to the disruptions in the tax
exempt capital markets.
Collateral Requirements of the
Competitive Energy Business
In conducting its retail energy supply
business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of declining energy
prices, has been exposed to the asymmetrical risk of having to post
collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts without receiving
a corresponding amount of collateral from its retail customers. To
partially address these asymmetrical collateral obligations, Pepco
Energy Services, in the first quarter of 2009, entered into a
credit intermediation arrangement with Morgan Stanley Capital
Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement, MSCG, in consideration
for the payment to MSCG of certain fees, (i) has assumed by
novation certain electricity purchase obligations of Pepco Energy
Services in years 2009 through 2011 under several wholesale
purchase contracts and (ii) has agreed to supply electricity
to Pepco Energy Services on the same terms as the novated
transactions, but without imposing on Pepco Energy Services any
associated collateral obligations. As of June 30, 2009,
approximately 32% of Pepco Energy Services’ wholesale
electricity purchase obligations (measured in megawatt hours) were
covered by this credit intermediation arrangement with
MSCG. The fees incurred by Pepco Energy Services in the amount
of $25 million are being amortized into expense in declining
amounts over the life of the arrangement based on the fair value of
the underlying contracts at the time of novation. For the three and
six months ended June 30, 2009, approximately $7 million and
$8 million, respectively, of the fees have been
amortized. In addition to Pepco Energy
Service’s retail energy supply business, Conectiv Energy and
Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business enter into
various other contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and
related products, including derivative instruments, designed to
reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their
assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These
contracts also typically have collateral requirements.
Depending on the contract terms, the
collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy Services and
Conectiv Energy can be of varying forms, including cash and letters
of credit. As of June 30, 2009, the Competitive Energy
business (including Pepco Energy Service’s retail energy
supply business) had posted net cash collateral of $443 million and
letters of credit of $182 million. At December 31, 2008, the
Competitive Energy business had posted net cash collateral of $331
million and letters of credit of $558 million.
At June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity
under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to meet the
future liquidity needs of the Competitive Energy business totaled
$915 million and $684 million, respectively. "

Credit
Facilities
PHI’s principal credit source is
an unsecured $1.5 billion syndicated credit facility, which can be
used by PHI and its utility subsidiaries to borrow funds, obtain
letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper.
This facility is in effect until May 2012 and consists of
commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is responsible for
more than 8.5% of the total $1.5 billion commitment. PHI’s
credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit
of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the lesser of $500 million and the
maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding
by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of
credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively
may not exceed $625 million.
In November 2008, PHI entered into a
second unsecured credit facility in the amount of $400 million with
a syndicate of nine lenders. Under the facility, PHI may
obtain revolving loans and swingline loans over the term of the
facility, which expires on November 6, 2009. The facility does
not provide for the issuance of letters of credit. These two
facilities are referred to collectively as PHI’s
“primary credit facilities.”
PHI and its utility subsidiaries
historically have issued commercial paper to meet their short-term
working capital requirements. As a result of the disruptions
in the commercial paper market in 2008, the companies borrowed
under the $1.5 billion credit facility to create a cash reserve for
future short-term operating needs. At June 30, 2009, PHI
had an outstanding loan of $150 million and DPL had an outstanding
loan of $50 million under the credit facility. DPL repaid its loan
in July 2009.
At June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity
under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to meet the
future liquidity needs of PHI on a consolidated basis totaled $1.5
billion, of which the combined cash and borrowing capacity under
the $1.5 billion credit facility of PHI’s utility
subsidiaries was $549 million and $843 million,
respectively.

5,2009-08-06,29989,XBRL," 5. Debt Short-Term Borrowings: Short-term borrowings of $42.0 million at June 30, 2009 are primarily comprised of bank overdrafts of our international subsidiaries. The bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to our bank agreements. At December 31, 2008, short-term borrowings were $16.2 million. Lines of Credit: We have a $2.5 billion credit facility expiring on June 23, 2011. We have the ability to classify borrowings under this facility as long-term debt. Our credit facility provides back- up liquidity in the event that any of our convertible notes are put back to us, as well as support for our commercial paper. At June 30, 2009, there were $200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility. This amount is included in long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The gross amount of borrowings and repayments under the credit facility during the first six months of 2009 was approximately $16 billion, with an average term of approximately 11 days. The gross amount of commercial paper issued and redeemed under our commercial paper program during the first six months of 2009 was approximately $5.7 billion, with an average term of approximately 4 days. Depending on market conditions at the time, we either issue commercial paper or borrow under our credit facility or on our uncommitted lines of credit to manage short-term cash requirements primarily related to changes in our day-to-day working capital requirements. Long-Term Debt and Convertible Debt: On February 9, 2009, holders of $841.2 million aggregate principal amount of our Liquid Yield Option Notes due February 7, 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) put their notes to us for purchase at par and $5.8 million of the 2031 Notes remain outstanding. We borrowed $814.4 million under our credit facility and received $26.8 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 Notes. We repurchased and retired $295.2 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes that had been put. We loaned the partnership $493.4 million and contributed $25.8 million as our equity investment. The partnership used the proceeds from the loan which it combined with the total contributed equity to purchase the remaining $546.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes that were put. The partnership purchased the 2031 Notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions warrant. The partnership is consolidated in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, as amended, and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and as a result, all of the 2031 Notes held by the partnership are eliminated in consolidation. On February 12, 2009, we paid a supplemental interest payment of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2031 Notes. The partnership that financed the purchase of $546.0 million of our 2031 Notes on our behalf was paid a supplemental interest payment of $27.3 million and the other noteholders who did not put their notes were paid a supplemental interest payment of $0.3 million. The loan made to the partnership bears interest at 3.35% per annum. On consolidation, interest income from the loan to the partnership offsets interest expense from the amortization of the supplemental interest payment made to the partnership resulting in net interest expense of $2.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Long-term debt outstanding as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 consisted of the following (dollars in millions): 2009 2008 Senior Notes - due April 15, 2016 $ 996.6 $ 996.4 Borrowings under $2.5 billion credit facility due June 23, 2011 200.0 — Other notes and loans 18.7 19.1 1,215.3 1,015.5 Less current portion 2.1 2.7 Total $ 1,213.2 $ 1,012.8 Convertible debt outstanding as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 consisted of the following (dollars in millions): 2009 2008 Convertible Notes - due February 7, 2031 $ 5.8 $ 847.0 Convertible Notes - due July 31, 2032 727.0 727.0 Convertible Notes - due June 15, 2033 0.1 0.1 Convertible Notes - due July 1, 2038 467.4 467.4 1,200.3 2,041.5 Less current portion — — Total $ 1,200.3 $ 2,041.5 /*<![CDATA[*/ v\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} o\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} w\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} .shape {behavior:url(#default#VML);} <!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:""Cambria Math"";

The carrying value of debt had been adjusted based upon the

Facilities
Commercial paper consists of senior
unsecured debt sold on a discounted basis with maturities of up to
270 days. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had $60 million of
outstanding commercial paper with interest rates ranging from 0.9%
to 1.0%.
In November 2008, the Company entered
into a $750 million 364-day revolving bank credit facility. The
interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is
calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus
a spread. At June 30, 2009, the interest rate on this
facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 1.7% to 2.1%.
As of June 30, 2009, the Company had no amounts outstanding
under this credit facility and it was terminated on July 31,
2009.
In May 2007, the Company amended and
restated its $1.3 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility
which included increasing the capacity. There is currently $2.5
billion available under this credit facility which matures in May
2012. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is
calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. At June 30, 2009, the
interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have
ranged from 0.5% to 1.4%. This credit facility supports the
Company’s commercial paper program and is available for
general working capital purposes. As of June 30, 2009, the
Company had no amounts outstanding under this credit
facility.
Debt Covenants
The Company’s debt arrangements
and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most
restrictive of which require the Company to maintain a
debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial
paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and
shareholders’ equity, below 50%. The Company was in
compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as
of June 30, 2009.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities
In January 2009, the Company terminated
interest rate swap contracts with $4.9 billion in notional value to
lock-in the benefit of low market interest rates. The cumulative
adjustment to the carrying value of the Company’s debt of
$513 million, as of the date that the swap contracts were
terminated, is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense
over the remaining life of the related debt. As of June 30,
2009, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts.
As of December 31, 2008, the fair values of the interest rate
swaps were $622 million with $7 million classified in Other Current
Assets and $615 million classified in Other Assets. "

The Amended Credit Facilities enhance the Company’s financial flexibility by increasing the Company’s maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facilities) from 4.50x to 5.50x. Additionally, the definition of Consolidated EBITDA used in the Amended Credit Facilities has been modified to exclude certain cash severance expenses from Consolidated EBITDA. In connection with the amendment, the Company repaid $500 million of its term loan that was due June 2009 by drawing down on its revolver. In connection with the amendment, the Company agreed to increase the pricing on the outstanding Amended Credit Facilities based upon the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Company’s unsecured debt rating and the type of loan borrowed. The margin increases range from 2.00% to 3.50% for term loans maintained as Eurodollar Loans, 1.75% to 3.00% for revolving loans maintained as Euro Rate Loans, and 0.00% to 1.50% for Base Rate and Canadian Prime Rate Loans. The applicable margin for the Facility Fee ranges from 0.25% to 0.50%. The amendment further modifies the Amended Credit Facilities by (i.) restricting the Company’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock depending on the Company’s free cash flow and Consolidated Leverage Ratio and (ii.) decreasing the Company’s permitted lien basket from 10% of Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Amended Credit Facilities) to 5% of Net Tangible Assets. An amendment fee of 50 basis points was also paid to all consenting lenders who approved the Amended Credit Facilities, with no amendment fee being paid on the repaid portion of the term loan. On April 30, 2009, the Company launched and priced a public offering of $500 million of senior notes with a coupon rate of 7.875% (the “Notes”) due October 15, 2014, issued at a discount price of 96.285%. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $475 million on the settlement date of May 7, 2009. The proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under its Amended Credit Facilities and for general purposes. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at any time at the Company’s option at a discount rate of Treasury plus 50 basis points. The Notes will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. "

Note 9. Junior Subordinated
Convertible Debentures In 2007, the Company issued
$1.25 billion principal amount of 3.25% convertible debentures due
August 15, 2037, to an initial purchaser in a private
offering. The Convertible Debentures are subordinated in right of
payment to the Company’s existing and future senior debt and
to the other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The
Convertible Debentures are initially convertible, subject to
certain conditions, into shares of the Company common stock at a
conversion rate of 29.0968 shares of common stock per $1,000
principal amount of Convertible Debentures, representing an initial
effective conversion price of approximately $34.37 per share of
common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment for
certain events as outlined in the Indenture governing the
Convertible Debentures but will not be adjusted for accrued
interest. As of June 30, 2009, the if-converted value of the
Convertible Debentures does not exceed its principal
amount. Effective January 1,
2009, the Company retroactively adopted FSP APB 14-1,
“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
Settlement).” FSP APB 14-1 specifies that issuers of
convertible debt instruments should separately account for the
liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of such
instruments in a manner that reflects the borrowing rate for a
similar non-convertible debt. The Company calculated the
carrying value of the liability component at issuance as the
present value of its cash flows using a discount rate of 8.5%
(borrowing rate for similar non-convertible debt with no contingent
payment options), adjusted for the fair value of the contingent
interest feature, yielding an effective interest rate of 8.39%. The
carrying value of the liability component was determined to be
$550.5 million. The excess of the principal amount of the debt over
the carrying value of the liability component is also called
“debt discount” or “equity component” of
the Convertible Debentures. The equity component of the Convertible
Debentures on the date of issuance was $700.7 million. The debt
discount will be amortized using the Company’s effective
interest rate of 8.39% over the term of the Convertible Debentures
as a non-cash charge to interest expense included in Other loss,
net. As of June 30, 2009, the remaining term of the
Convertible Debentures is 28.2 years. The table below presents the

The fair value of the derivatives at the date of issuance of the
Convertible Debentures was $11.4 million including $7.8
million for the contingent interest payment features and $3.6
million for the over-allotment option feature, which is accounted
for as a discount on the Convertible Debentures. The over-allotment
feature was revalued at $12.6 million on the date of exercise at
August 28, 2007, which is currently accounted for as a premium
on the Convertible Debentures. The debt discount and the debt
premium are being accreted to the face value of the Convertible
Debentures as net interest expense over 30 years. The balances of
the debt discount and debt premium are included in the carrying
amount of the liability component. "

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company repaid the full
amount outstanding under its revolving line of credit in its senior
secured credit facilities. The revolving line of credit’s
variable interest rates ranged from 1.59 percent to 2.45 percent,
and the weighted average rate was 1.77 percent during the six
months ended June 30, 2009. Letters of credit are deducted in
determining the total amount available for borrowing under the
revolving credit agreement. Accordingly, the total amount
outstanding under the letters of credit and the indebtedness
incurred under the revolving credit agreement may not exceed $500.0
million. At June 30, 2009, the amount available for borrowing
under the revolving credit agreement was $493.2
million. (b)
The Company’s collateralized Valor debt is equally and
ratably secured with debt under the senior secured credit
facilities. Debt held by Windstream Holdings of the Midwest, Inc.,
a subsidiary of the Company, is secured solely by the assets of the
subsidiary. (c)
Certain of the Company’s debentures and notes are
callable by the Company at various premiums on early
redemption. The terms of the senior
secured credit facilities and indentures include customary
covenants that, among other things, require Windstream to maintain
certain financial ratios, restrict its ability to incur additional
indebtedness, and limit its cash payments. These financial ratios
include a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5 to 1.0 and a minimum
interest coverage ratio of 2.75 to 1.0. In addition, the covenants
include restrictions on dividend and certain other types of
payments, as well as restrictions on capital expenditures, which
must not exceed a specified amount in any fiscal year (for 2009
this amount is $582.5 million, which includes $132.5 million of
unused capacity from 2008). In addition, certain of the
Company’s debt agreements contain various covenants and
restrictions specific to the subsidiary that is the legal
counterparty to the agreement. Under the Company’s long-term
debt agreements, acceleration of principal payments would occur
upon payment default, violation of debt covenants not cured within
30 days, a change in control including a person or group obtaining
50 percent or more of Windstream’s outstanding voting stock,
or breach of certain other conditions set forth in the borrowing
agreements. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as

four identical pay fixed, receive variable interest rate swap
agreements totaling $1,600.0 million in notional value in order to
mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its variable rate
senior secured credit facilities. The four interest rate swap
agreements amortize quarterly to a notional value of $906.3 million
at maturity on July 17, 2013. The variable rate received
resets on the seventeenth day of each quarter to the three-month
LIBOR (London-Interbank Offered Rate). The Company’s interest
rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges of the
interest rate risk created by the variable interest rate paid on
Tranche B of the senior secured credit facilities, which
matures on July 17, 2013. The variable interest rate paid on
Tranche B is based on the three-month LIBOR, and it also
resets on the seventeenth day of each quarter. After the completion of a
refinancing transaction in February 2007, a portion of one of the
four interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $125.0
million ($100.4 million as of June 30, 2009) was de-designated
as the corresponding hedged item was repaid. Therefore, the
undesignated portion of the swap agreement was no longer an
effective hedge of the variable interest rate paid on
Tranche B. Set forth below is

% The effectiveness of the
Company’s cash flow hedges is assessed each quarter using the
“Change in Variable Cash Flow Method”, or Method 1,
described in Derivatives Implementation Group (“DIG”)
Issue No. G7, “Cash Flow Hedges: Measuring the
Ineffectiveness of a Cash Flow Hedge under Paragraph 30(b)
When the Shortcut Method Is Not Applied”. Method 1 utilizes
the matched terms principle of measuring effectiveness, and
requires the floating-rate leg of the swap and the hedged variable
cash flows of the asset or liability to be based on the same
interest rate index. It also requires the variable interest rates
of both instruments to reset on the same dates. Furthermore, there
should be no other differences in the terms of the hedge and the
hedged item, and the likelihood of default by the interest rate
swap counterparties must be assessed as being unlikely in order to
conclude that there is no ineffectiveness in the hedging
relationship. The Company performs and documents this assessment
under Method 1 each quarter, and it concluded at June 30, 2009
that there was no ineffectiveness to be recognized in earnings for
any of its four interest rate swap agreements that are designated
as hedges. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the Company
recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets as either assets or
liabilities depending on the rights or obligations under the
related contracts. Changes in fair value of
these derivative instruments were as follows for the three and six

7. LONG-TERM DEBT The Company has two types of
debt reported on its balance sheet: non-recourse and recourse debt.
Non-recourse debt is used to fund investments and capital
expenditures for the construction and acquisition of electric power
plants, wind farms and distribution companies at our subsidiaries.
Non-recourse debt is generally secured by the capital stock,
physical assets, contracts and cash flows of the related
subsidiary. The default risk is limited to the respective business
and is without recourse to the Parent Company and other
subsidiaries. Recourse debt is direct borrowings by the Parent
Company and is used to fund development, construction or
acquisition and serves as funding to equity investments or loans to
the affiliates. This debt is with recourse to the Parent Company
and is structurally subordinated to the affiliates’
non-recourse debt. Recourse and non-recourse
debt are carried at amortized cost. The following table summarizes
the carrying amount and estimated fair values of the
Company’s recourse and non-recourse debt as of June 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008: June 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 Carrying

non-recourse debt is estimated differently depending upon the type
of loan. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated using
quoted market prices or a discounted cash flow analysis. For
variable rate loans, carrying value typically approximates fair
value. At December 31, 2008, credit spreads were significantly
above historic levels. For the U.S. Dollar, Euro and British
Pound markets where the Company believed the expanded credit spread
was material, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow
analysis. The increase in credit spreads was calculated as the
difference between composite fair value curves, published by
pricing services for the relevant issuer credit rating, and London
Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). For all other
currencies, the Company continued to assume the carrying value was
equal to fair value. As of June 30, 2009, credit spreads had
returned to a typical range for all currencies and the Company
determined that carrying value approximated fair value for all of
our variable rate debt. The estimated fair value was
determined using available market information as of June 30,
2009. The Company is not aware of any factors that would
significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts subsequent to
June 30, 2009.
Non-Recourse Debt Subsidiary non-recourse debt
in default or accelerated, including any temporarily waived
default, is classified as current debt in the accompanying
condensed consolidated balance sheets. The following table
summarizes the Company’s subsidiary non-recourse debt in
default or accelerated as of June 30, 2009: Subsidiary Primary Nature
of Default June 30, 2009 Default Net Assets (in millions) Kelanitissa Covenant $

subsidiary in Nigeria, received a waiver of default on
September 18, 2008. The waiver gives Ebute until
December 31, 2009 to cure the breached covenants; however, as
this waiver does not extend beyond the Company’s current
reporting cycle and the probability of curing the default cannot be
determined, the debt was classified as current. None of the subsidiaries that
are currently in default is a material subsidiary under The AES
Corporation’s corporate debt agreements whose defaults would
trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such
indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of
assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or
other matters in the future that may impact the Company’s
financial position and results of operations, it is possible that
one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition
of a “material subsidiary”, and thereby upon an
acceleration of its non-recourse debt, trigger an event of default
and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent
Company’s outstanding debt agreements. On April 8, 2009, AES
Gener S.A. (“Gener”) issued $196 million aggregate
principal amount of 8% unsecured notes due in 2019. The unsecured
notes were priced at a discount to par resulting in an 8.5% yield.
The proceeds from this issuance will be used to provide
Gener’s funding requirements for projects under
construction.
Recourse Debt On March 26, 2009, the
Parent Company and certain subsidiary guarantors amended the Parent
Company’s existing senior secured credit facility pursuant to
the terms of Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment
No. 1”) to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and
Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2008 (the
“senior secured credit facility”). The senior secured
credit facility previously included a $200 million term loan
facility maturing on August 10, 2011 and a $750 million
revolving credit facility maturing on June 23, 2010 (the
“revolving credit facility”). The principal modification
set forth in Amendment No. 1 was a one-year extension of $570
million of revolving credit facility commitments from an original
maturity date of June 23, 2010 to July 5, 2011. In
addition, certain lenders determined that they would increase their
commitment under the revolving credit facility by $35 million from
March 26, 2009 through July 5, 2011. Accordingly,
Amendment No. 1 increased the size of the revolving credit
facility from $750 million to $785 million for the period between
the dates of Amendment No. 1 and June 23, 2010. Between
June 23, 2010 and July 5, 2011, the revolving credit
facility size will be $605 million. No modifications were made to
the amount or maturity date of the $200 million term loan
facility. The extended commitments from
this amendment were subject to new pricing that included an upfront
fee of 1.25% for participating in the extensions and an increase in
undrawn commitment fees from 50 to 100 basis points. The annual
interest rate on the drawn loans was also increased by 200 basis
points to LIBOR plus 3.50%. Pricing and all other material terms
remain unchanged for the revolving credit facility commitments
which have not been extended. On April 2, 2009 the
Parent Company issued $535 million aggregate principal amount of
9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2016 in a private placement. The
notes were priced at a discount to yield 11%. Subsequently, the
Parent Company allocated a substantial portion of the proceeds to
voluntarily reduce the size of its $600 million senior unsecured
credit facility among the Parent Company, Merrill Lynch Bank USA
and the banks party thereto (the “senior unsecured credit
facility”), by $465 million. The remaining $135 million under
the senior unsecured credit facility consists of letters of credit,
the majority of which support several projects currently under
construction. On June 1, 2009, the
Parent Company repaid at maturity all outstanding 9.5% senior
unsecured notes at par for an aggregate principal amount of $154
million.

We extinguished
2.0 billion yen (par value) of our Uridashi notes due September 2016 at a cost of 1.4 billion yen, yielding a gain of
.6 billion yen. We extinguished 3.4 billion yen (par value) of our Samurai notes due June 2012 at a cost of 2.5 billion yen, yielding a gain of
.9 billion yen. We extinguished .6 billion yen (par value) of our Samurai notes due July 2010 at a cost of .5 billion yen, yielding a gain of
.1 billion yen. Through these transactions, we realized a total gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after-tax), which we included in other income. In April 2009, we used internally generated cash flow to pay off our $450 million senior notes upon their maturity. In May 2009, we issued $850 million of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering. These notes pay interest semi-annually and have a 10-year maturity. The notes are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) the principal amount of the notes or (ii) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In July 2009, we executed a 10 billion yen loan (approximately $104 million using the June 30, 2009, exchange rate) at an interest rate of
3.60%. Interest on the loan is payable semiannually, and the loan has a six-year maturity. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at June 30, 2009. No events of default or defaults occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2009. For additional information, see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our annual report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2008. /*<![CDATA[*/ v:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} o:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} w:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} .shape {behavior:url(#default#VML);} st1:*{behavior:url(#ieooui) } <!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:""MS Mincho""; panose-1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; mso-font-alt:"" ""; mso-font-charset:128; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-format:other; mso-font-pitch:fixed; mso-font-signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;} @font-face {font-family:""@MS Mincho""; panose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; mso-font-charset:128; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-format:other; mso-font-pitch:fixed; mso-font-signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;} /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""MS Mincho"";} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} /*]]>*/ "

Borrowings Our short-term borrowings may include
bank loans, commercial paper, and bank lines of credit. Short-term borrowings
mature within one year from the date of issuance. We pay commitment fees to
banks for providing us lines of credit. When we borrow under the lines of
credit, we pay market interest rates. Constellation Energy Constellation Energy had bank and
other lines of credit under committed unsecured credit facilities totaling
$5.6 billion at June 30, 2009 for short-term financial needs. We enter
into these facilities to ensure adequate liquidity to support our operations. Our liquidity
requirements are funded with credit facilities and cash. We fund our short-term
working capital needs with existing cash and with our credit facilities, which
support direct cash borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, if
available. We also use our credit facilities to support the issuance of letters
of credit, primarily for our merchant energy business. These facilities can
issue letters of credit, commercial paper, if available, and/or cash borrowings
up to approximately $5.6 billion as shown below. As of June 30, 2009,
we had approximately $2.8 billion in letters of credit issued against those
facilities. We have also included in
the table below the pro forma effect on our credit facilities, which are reduced

5.0 Other Sources of Liquidity In December 2008, we executed an
Investment Agreement with EDF that includes an asset put arrangement that
provides us with an option at any time through December 31, 2010 (or the
termination of the Investment Agreement by EDF if we breach that agreement) to
sell certain non-nuclear generation assets, at pre-agreed prices, to EDF for
aggregate proceeds of no more than $2 billion pre-tax, or approximately
$1.4 billion after-tax. The amount of after-tax proceeds will be impacted
by the assets actually sold and the related tax impacts at that time. Exercise
of the put arrangement is conditioned upon the receipt of regulatory approvals
and third-party consents, the absence of any material liens on such assets, and
the absence of a material adverse effect, as defined in the Investment
Agreement. During April 2009, we received regulatory approvals and consents for
the majority of the assets covered by the put arrangement. As of June 30,
2009, we have approximately $1.1 billion after-tax of liquidity available
through the put arrangement. We expect to receive regulatory approval for an
additional asset in the first quarter of 2010, which will increase the net
after-tax liquidity from the put arrangement to approximately
$1.4 billion. We are actively seeking
to increase available liquidity and to reduce our business risk. Specifically,
we are reducing capital spending and ongoing expenses, scaling down the expected
variability in long-term earnings and short-term collateral usage, and limiting
our exposure to business activities that require contingent capital support.
During 2009, we made progress on several other initiatives as discussed in more
detail in the Divestitures
section beginning on page 15 and the Variable
Interest Entities section on page 12. As of
June 30, 2009 we have realized substantially all of the $1 billion of
the net reduction in collateral that was expected from the divestiture of these
operations. We believe that the
actions that we have taken and our current net available liquidity will be
sufficient to support the ongoing liquidity requirements over the next
12 months. Our liquidity projections include assumptions for commodity
price changes, which are subject to significant volatility, and we are exposed
to certain operational risks that could have a significant impact on our
liquidity. Credit Facility Compliance and
Covenants The credit facilities of
Constellation Energy and BGE have limited material adverse change clauses, none
of which would prohibit draws under the existing facilities. Certain credit facilities
of Constellation Energy contain a provision requiring Constellation Energy to
maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 65%. At
June 30, 2009, the debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the credit
agreements was 51%. Under our
$3.85 billion and $1.23 billion credit facilities, we will be required
to grant a lien on certain of our generating facilities and pledge our ownership
interests in our nuclear business to the lenders upon the earlier of
(i) the closing of the Investment Agreement with EDF or (ii) the date
on which both the Investment Agreement is terminated and our Standard &
Poors (S&P) or Fitch senior unsecured debt credit rating is below BBB- or
our Moody's senior unsecured debt credit rating is below Baa3. Our $1.23 billion
credit facility requires us to maintain consolidated earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization to consolidated interest expense ratio of
at least 2.75 when our S&P senior unsecured debt rating is BBB- or lower and
our Moody's senior unsecured debt rating is Baa3 or lower. Compliance with the
covenant is not required as of July 31, 2009 as S&P's senior unsecured
debt rating is above BBB-. The credit agreement of
BGE contains a provision requiring BGE to maintain a ratio of debt to
capitalization equal to or less than 65%. At June 30, 2009, the debt to
capitalization ratio for BGE as defined in this credit agreement was 52%. "

The Company had availability of $425.0 million under its credit facilities at June 30, 2009. On March 6, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Credit Amendment”) to its $800.0 million secured revolving credit facility. The Credit Amendment amended certain covenants to make them less restrictive, including those related to lien creation, restricted payments and subsidiary guarantees of debt, in addition to an increase in the maximum leverage ratio, as defined, that the Company must maintain. In connection with these changes, the borrowing pricing grid was increased by 200 basis points and the rate on the unused portion of the facility was increased to 50 basis points. As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had $375.0 million and $205.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, respectively. At June 30, 2009, the Company had availability of $425.0 million under the revolving credit facility. On March 31, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to its accounts receivable securitization program revising certain terms to strengthen the credit quality of the pool of receivables and increasing the interest rate. The credit facility supporting the borrowings under the program was also renewed and now expires March 31, 2010. The size of the program continues to allow for aggregate borrowings and letters of credit of up to $175.0 million, as limited by eligible accounts receivable. The Company had borrowings under the program of $59.9 million at June 30, 2009 and $68.6 million at December 31, 2008. The Company also had letters of credit outstanding under the securitization program of $60.5 million as of June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2009, the Company had no availability under the accounts receivable securitization program. Economic conditions have impacted the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper up to the $100.0 million maximum aggregate principal amount of the program. The commercial paper placement program is supported by a line of credit that has been renewed and expires on April 30, 2010. At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s senior notes and other long-term debt, including amounts classified as current, was $1,347.7 million and $1,178.0 million, respectively. /*<![CDATA[*/ <!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} p.Char, li.Char, div.Char {mso-style-name:"" Char""; mso-style-link:""Default Paragraph Font""; margin-top:0in; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:12.0pt; margin-left:0in; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} /*]]>*/ "

The facilities consist of a $1.5 billion facility and a $450 million facility in the U.S., a $200 million facility in Australia and a $150 million facility in Canada. There are no outstanding borrowings or commercial paper at quarter-end, and the full $2.3 billion of unsecured credit facilities are available to the Company. The Company has available a $1.95 billion commercial paper program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under U.S. committed credit facilities, which expire in 2013. One of the Company’s Australian subsidiaries has a secured revolving syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments, offshore Western Australia. The facility provides for total commitments of $350 million, with availability determined by a borrowing base formula. The borrowing base was set at $350 million and will be redetermined after the fields commence production and certain tests have been met, and semi-annually thereafter. The outstanding balance under the facility as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, was $245 million and $100 million. At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there was $12.2 million and $12.6 million, respectively, borrowed on uncommitted overdraft lines in Argentina.

Borrowings Short-Term
Borrowings In August 2007, the Company
entered into a five-year $2,500 unsecured revolving credit facility
(“the 2007 facility”). The 2007 facility requires the
Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash)
of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2009, the
Company had $200 outstanding under the 2007 facility with an
interest rate of 0.49% and a maturity date during July 2009. During
July 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 in borrowings with an
interest rate of 0.47% and a maturity date in August
2009. Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc.
has a $140 participation under the 2007 facility; however,
BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. will
honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. Bank of America, a related
party, has a $140 participation under the 2007 facility. In June 2009, BlackRock Japan
Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, renewed its
five billion Japanese yen commitment-line agreement with a banking
institution (the “Japan Commitment-line”) for a term of
one year. The Japan Commitment-line is intended to provide
liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At
June 30, 2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under
the Japan Commitment-line. Convertible

Borrowings Our short-term borrowings may include
bank loans, commercial paper, and bank lines of credit. Short-term borrowings
mature within one year from the date of issuance. We pay commitment fees to
banks for providing us lines of credit. When we borrow under the lines of
credit, we pay market interest rates. Constellation Energy Constellation Energy had bank and
other lines of credit under committed unsecured credit facilities totaling
$5.6 billion at June 30, 2009 for short-term financial needs. We enter
into these facilities to ensure adequate liquidity to support our operations. Our liquidity
requirements are funded with credit facilities and cash. We fund our short-term
working capital needs with existing cash and with our credit facilities, which
support direct cash borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, if
available. We also use our credit facilities to support the issuance of letters
of credit, primarily for our merchant energy business. These facilities can
issue letters of credit, commercial paper, if available, and/or cash borrowings
up to approximately $5.6 billion as shown below. As of June 30, 2009,
we had approximately $2.8 billion in letters of credit issued against those

five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2011. BGE can borrow directly
from the banks, use the facility to allow commercial paper to be issued, if
available, or issue letters of credit. As of June 30, 2009, BGE had
$0.5 million in letters of credit issued under this facility. In addition, at
June 30, 2009, BGE had $339.9 million in commercial paper outstanding. Net Available Liquidity The following table provides a

5.0 Other Sources of Liquidity In December 2008, we executed an
Investment Agreement with EDF that includes an asset put arrangement that
provides us with an option at any time through December 31, 2010 (or the
termination of the Investment Agreement by EDF if we breach that agreement) to
sell certain non-nuclear generation assets, at pre-agreed prices, to EDF for
aggregate proceeds of no more than $2 billion pre-tax, or approximately
$1.4 billion after-tax. The amount of after-tax proceeds will be impacted
by the assets actually sold and the related tax impacts at that time. Exercise
of the put arrangement is conditioned upon the receipt of regulatory approvals
and third-party consents, the absence of any material liens on such assets, and
the absence of a material adverse effect, as defined in the Investment
Agreement. During April 2009, we received regulatory approvals and consents for
the majority of the assets covered by the put arrangement. As of June 30,
2009, we have approximately $1.1 billion after-tax of liquidity available
through the put arrangement. We expect to receive regulatory approval for an
additional asset in the first quarter of 2010, which will increase the net
after-tax liquidity from the put arrangement to approximately
$1.4 billion. We are actively seeking
to increase available liquidity and to reduce our business risk. Specifically,
we are reducing capital spending and ongoing expenses, scaling down the expected
variability in long-term earnings and short-term collateral usage, and limiting
our exposure to business activities that require contingent capital support.
During 2009, we made progress on several other initiatives as discussed in more
detail in the Divestitures
section beginning on page 15 and the Variable
Interest Entities section on page 12. As of
June 30, 2009 we have realized substantially all of the $1 billion of
the net reduction in collateral that was expected from the divestiture of these
operations. We believe that the
actions that we have taken and our current net available liquidity will be
sufficient to support the ongoing liquidity requirements over the next
12 months. Our liquidity projections include assumptions for commodity
price changes, which are subject to significant volatility, and we are exposed
to certain operational risks that could have a significant impact on our
liquidity. Credit Facility Compliance and
Covenants The credit facilities of
Constellation Energy and BGE have limited material adverse change clauses, none
of which would prohibit draws under the existing facilities. Certain credit facilities
of Constellation Energy contain a provision requiring Constellation Energy to
maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 65%. At
June 30, 2009, the debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the credit
agreements was 51%. Under our
$3.85 billion and $1.23 billion credit facilities, we will be required
to grant a lien on certain of our generating facilities and pledge our ownership
interests in our nuclear business to the lenders upon the earlier of
(i) the closing of the Investment Agreement with EDF or (ii) the date
on which both the Investment Agreement is terminated and our Standard &
Poors (S&P) or Fitch senior unsecured debt credit rating is below BBB- or
our Moody's senior unsecured debt credit rating is below Baa3. Our $1.23 billion
credit facility requires us to maintain consolidated earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization to consolidated interest expense ratio of
at least 2.75 when our S&P senior unsecured debt rating is BBB- or lower and
our Moody's senior unsecured debt rating is Baa3 or lower. Compliance with the
covenant is not required as of July 31, 2009 as S&P's senior unsecured
debt rating is above BBB-. The credit agreement of
BGE contains a provision requiring BGE to maintain a ratio of debt to
capitalization equal to or less than 65%. At June 30, 2009, the debt to
capitalization ratio for BGE as defined in this credit agreement was 52%. "

Duke Energy issued $750 million principal amount of 6.30% senior
notes due February 1, 2014. Proceeds from the issuance were
used to redeem commercial paper and for general corporate
purposes. In June 2008, Duke Energy issued $500
million principal amount of senior notes, of which $250 million
carries a fixed interest rate of 5.65% and matures June 15,
2013 and $250 million carries a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and
matures June 15, 2018. Proceeds from the issuance were used to
redeem commercial paper, to fund capital expenditures in Duke
Energy’s unregulated businesses in the U.S. and for general
corporate purposes. First and Refunding Mortgage
Bonds. In March 2009, Duke Energy Ohio issued $450 million
principal amount of first mortgage bonds, which carry a fixed
interest rate of 5.45% and mature April 1, 2019. Proceeds from
this issuance were used to repay short-term notes and for general
corporate purposes, including funding capital
expenditures. In March 2009, Duke Energy Indiana
issued $450 million principal amount of first mortgage bonds, which
carry a fixed interest rate of 6.45% and mature April 1, 2039.
Proceeds from this issuance were used to fund capital expenditures,
to replenish cash used to repay $97 million of senior notes which
matured on March 15, 2009, to fund the repayment at maturity
of $125 million of first mortgage bonds due July 15, 2009, and
for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of
short-term notes. In January 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas
issued $900 million principal amount of mortgage refunding bonds,
of which $400 million carry a fixed interest rate of 5.25% and
mature January 15, 2018 and $500 million carry a fixed
interest rate of 6.00% and mature January 15, 2038. Proceeds

general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial
paper. In anticipation of this debt issuance, Duke Energy Carolinas
executed a series of interest rate swaps in 2007 to lock in the
market interest rates at that time. The value of these interest
rate swaps, which were terminated prior to issuance of the fixed
rate debt, was a pre-tax loss of approximately $18 million. This
amount was recorded as a component of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss and is being amortized as a component of
Interest Expense over the life of the debt. In April 2008, Duke Energy Carolinas
issued $900 million principal amount of mortgage refunding bonds,
of which $300 million carries a fixed interest rate of 5.10% and

July 1, 2009. In January 2009, Duke Energy Indiana
refunded $271 million of tax-exempt auction rate bonds through the
issuance of $271 million of tax-exempt variable-rate demand bonds,

total credit facility capacity under Duke Energy’s master
credit facility is approximately $3.14 billion. Duke Energy has the
unilateral ability under the master credit facility to increase or
decrease the borrowing sub limits of each borrower, subject to
maximum cap limitations, at any time. See table below for the
borrowing sub limits at June 30, 2009 for each of the Duke
Energy entities with borrowing capacity under this credit facility.
The amount available under the master credit facility has been
reduced by draw downs of cash and the use of the master credit
facility to backstop the issuances of commercial paper, letters of
credit and certain pollution control bonds. Master Credit Facility Summary as of

Indiana and $100 million for Duke Energy Kentucky. At June 30, 2009, Duke Energy and
its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy
Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky (collectively referred to as the
borrowers), had outstanding borrowings of approximately $750
million under Duke Energy’s master credit facility as
follows: Amounts Borrowed
Under Master Credit
Facility (in millions) Duke Energy Corporation $
274 Duke Energy Ohio 279 Duke Energy Indiana 123 Duke Energy Kentucky 74 Total $
750 The loans under the master credit
facility are revolving credit loans that currently bear interest at
one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable
spread ranging from 19 to 24 basis points. The loan for Duke Energy
has a stated maturity of June 2012, while the loans for all of the
other borrowers have stated maturities of September 2009; however,
the borrowers have the ability under the master credit facility to
renew the loans due in September 2009 up through the date the
master credit facility matures in June 2012. Except for Duke Energy
Ohio, all of the borrowers have the intent and ability to refinance
these obligations on a long-term basis, either through renewal of
the terms of the loan through the master credit facility, which has
non-cancelable terms in excess of one-year, or through issuance of
long-term debt to replace the amounts drawn under the master credit
facility. Accordingly, borrowings of approximately $471 million are
reflected as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
both June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. As Duke Energy
Ohio does not have the intent to refinance its borrowings on a
long-term basis, amounts outstanding at both June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008 of approximately $279 million are reflected
in Notes Payable and Commercial Paper within Current Liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, approximately $1,023 million and $779
million, respectively, of pollution control bonds were classified
as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of this
amount, the master credit facility served as a backstop for
approximately $440 million of these pollution control bonds (of
which approximately $100 million is in the form of letters of
credit), with the remaining balance backstopped by other specific
credit facilities separate from the master credit facility.
Additionally, at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
approximately $477 million and $450 million, respectively, of
commercial paper issuances were classified as Long-Term Debt on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. These pollution control bonds and
commercial paper issuances, which are short-term obligations by
nature, are classified as long-term due to Duke Energy’s
intent and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term
financing. As Duke Energy’s master credit facility and other
specific purpose credit facilities have non-cancelable terms in
excess of one year as of the balance sheet date, Duke Energy has
the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on a
long-term basis. Restrictive Debt Covenants. Duke
Energy’s debt and credit agreements contain various financial
and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond
applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates
and/or termination of the agreements. As of June 30, 2009,
Duke Energy was in compliance with all covenants related to its
significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements
may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the
agreements due to nonpayment, or the acceleration of other
significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its
subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain
material adverse change clauses. "

(183) (108) Long-term debt...................................................................... $5,604 $5,725 The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. All of the senior notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, are unsecured and have been fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Principal on the senior notes is payable upon maturity, while interest is payable semi-annually. The fair value of our 8.375% senior notes was approximately $915 million at June 30, 2009 and approximately $904 million at December 31, 2008. The fair value of our 6.375% senior notes was approximately $924 million at June 30, 2009 and approximately $911 million at December 31, 2008. The fair value of our 7.625% senior notes was approximately $1,466 million at June 30, 2009 and approximately $1,451 million at December 31, 2008. We calculated the fair values based on quoted market prices of our senior notes, which is a Level 1 input under SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” or SFAS No. 157, on those dates. Our notes payable and senior secured credit facility mature as follows: $61 million in the remainder of 2009, $308 million in 2010, $108 million in 2011, $20 million in 2012, $2,796 million in 2013 and $2,500 million thereafter. These amounts do not reflect potential prepayments that may be required under our senior secured credit facility, which could result from a computation that we are required to make at each year end under the credit agreement. We were not required to make a prepayment for the year ended December 31, 2008. The amount of interest accrued related to our outstanding debt was $44 million at June 30, 2009 and $45 million at December 31, 2008. Covenants and Restrictions. The senior secured credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants. The senior notes and the senior secured credit facility also include covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) incur liens, (iii) pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, (iv) enter into certain transactions with affiliates, (v) merge or consolidate with another entity, (vi) sell, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, and (vii) make voluntary prepayments of certain debt, in each case subject to exceptions as provided in the credit agreement and senior notes indentures.

The amount of interest accrued related to our outstanding debt was $44 million at June 30, 2009 and $45 million at December 31, 2008.
Covenants and Restrictions. The senior secured credit facility requires DIRECTV U.S. to comply with certain financial covenants. The senior notes and the senior secured credit facility also include covenants that restrict DIRECTV U.S.’ ability to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) incur liens, (iii) pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, (iv) enter into certain transactions with affiliates, (v) merge or consolidate with another entity, (vi) sell, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, and (vii) make voluntary prepayments of certain debt, in each case subject to exceptions as provided in the credit agreement and senior notes indentures. Should DIRECTV U.S. fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of its borrowings under the senior notes and senior secured credit facility could become immediately payable and its revolving credit facility could be terminated. At June 30, 2009, DIRECTV U.S. was in compliance with all such covenants.

at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 consisted of the following (in
thousands): June 30, December 31, 2009 2008 Bank debt $ 339,000 $ 220,000 7.125% Notes due 2017 350,000 350,000 Floating rate convertible notes due 2023 (face value $19,450) 17,712 17,630 Total long-term debt $ 706,712 $ 587,630 Bank Debt In
April 2009, we entered into a new three-year senior secured revolving
credit facility (credit facility). The new credit facility increases
bank commitments from $500 million to $800 million, with a borrowing base of $1
billion. The credit facility is provided by a syndicate of banks led by JP
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., matures on April 14, 2012 and is secured by
mortgages on certain of our oil and gas properties and the stock of certain
wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. Like our
previous credit facility, the borrowing base is determined at the discretion of
the lenders, based on the collateral value of our proved reserves, and is
subject to potential special and regular semi-annual
redeterminations. The new
credit facility also contains similar covenants and restrictive provisions as
were contained in the previous credit facility, which may limit our ability to
incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The new credit agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio greater than 1
to 1 (unchanged) and a leverage ratio not to exceed 3.5 to 1 (increased from 3.0
to 1). As of June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all of the
financial and non-financial covenants. At
Cimarexs option, borrowings under the credit facility may bear interest at
either (a) a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2 to 3
percent, based on borrowing base usage, or (b) the higher of (i) a
prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50 percent, or
(iii) adjusted LIBOR, in each case, plus an additional 1.125 to 2.125
percent, based on borrowing base usage. At
June 30, 2009, there was $339 million of borrowings outstanding under
the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.6%.
We also had letters of credit outstanding of $2.8 million leaving an unused
borrowing availability of $458.2 million. 7.125% Notes due 2017 In May,
2007, we issued $350 million of 7.125% senior unsecured notes that mature
May 1, 2017 at par. Interest on the notes is payable May 1 and
November 1 of each year. The notes are governed by an indenture containing
covenants that could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay
dividends or repurchase our common stock; make investments and other restricted
payments; incur liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; engage in
transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer
assets. The notes
are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on and after
May 1, 2012 at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
the principal amount) plus accrued interest, if any, thereon to the date of
redemption. Year Percentage 2012 103.6 % 2013 102.4 % 2014 101.2 % 2015 and thereafter 100.0 % At any
time prior to May 1, 2010, we may redeem up to 35% of the original
principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings of
our shares of common stock at a redemption price of 107.125% of the principal
amount of the notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date of redemption. At any time prior to May 1, 2012, we may also
redeem all, but not part, of the notes at a price of 100% of the principal
amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a make-whole
premium. If a
specified change of control occurs, subject to certain conditions, we must make
an offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal
amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the
purchase. Floating rate convertible notes due
2023 The
floating rate convertible senior notes were assumed in the Magnum Hunter merger
and mature on December 15, 2023. The notes are senior unsecured obligations
and bear interest at the three month LIBOR, reset quarterly. On June 30,
2009, the interest rate was 0.62938%. The
holders as of December 15, 2008, had the right to require us to repurchase
all or a portion of the notes at a price of 100% of the principal amount (plus
accrued interest). As of December 15, 2008, holders with principal of
$105.550 million submitted their notes for repurchase leaving
$19.450 million still outstanding. We repurchased the $105.550 million
in notes with borrowings under our credit facility. The remaining notes have
future repurchase dates as of December 15, 2013, and 2018. We have the
right at any time to redeem some or all of the notes still outstanding at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount (plus accrued
interest). In
addition to the repurchase rights, holders of the convertible notes may
surrender their notes for conversion into a combination of cash and shares of
our common stock upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, including if the
price of our common stock has been trading above the conversion price of $28.59
per share for a defined period of time. As of June 30, 2009, and
December 31, 2008, the notes were not convertible. If a
specified change of control occurs, subject to certain conditions, we must make
an offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal
amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the
purchase. In May,
2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new Staff
Position APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That
May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement),
(FSP APB 14-1), that changed the accounting for the components of
convertible debt that can be settled wholly or partly in cash upon conversion.
The new requirements are required to be applied to both new instruments and
retrospectively to previously issued convertible instruments. The debt and
equity components of the instruments are accounted for separately. The value
assigned to the debt component is the estimated value of similar debt without a
conversion feature as of the issuance date, with the remaining proceeds
allocated to the equity component and recorded as additional paid-in capital.
The debt component is recorded at a discount and is subsequently accreted to its
par value, thereby reflecting an overall market rate of interest in the income
statement. We
adopted this Staff Position on January 1, 2009. Upon adoption we
retrospectively recorded a $30 million decrease in the book value of our
Floating Rate Convertible Notes to $109.2 million, as of June 7, 2005, with
a corresponding increase in additional paid-in-capital which results in a total
of $79.6 million attributable to the equity component. We also recorded
additional non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.9 million ($1.2
million after tax) per year for 2008, 2007 and 2006, which resulted in an
effective annual interest rate of 4.4%, 7.1% and 6.8%, respectively. The
effective interest rate for the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 was
2.2% and 4.1%, respectively. The effective interest rate for the six
months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 was 2.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Prior to the adoption, for the year ended December 31, 2008, we had
recorded a $9.6 million ($6.0 million net of tax) gain on the repurchase of
$105.6 million of the notes. Upon adoption, we retrospectively recorded a loss
on the repurchase of $10.1 million ($6.4 million after tax). The
following table reflects a comparison of certain financial statement line items
affected by the retrospective application of FSP APB 14-1. Summary of the Retrospective Application of

June 30, 2009 and matures in 2011. CGMHI also has committed long-term
financing facilities with unaffiliated banks. At June 30, 2009, CGMHI had
drawn down the full $900 million available under these facilities, of which
$350 million is guaranteed by Citigroup. Generally, a bank can terminate
these facilities by giving CGMHI one-year prior notice. The Company issues both
fixed and variable rate debt in a range of currencies. It uses derivative
contracts, primarily interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of
its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt and variable rate debt to fixed rate
debt. The maturity structure of the derivatives generally corresponds to the
maturity structure of the debt being hedged. In addition, the Company uses other
derivative contracts to manage the impact of FX translation certain debt
issuances. Citigroup and other U.S.
financial services firms are currently benefiting from government programs that
are improving markets and providing Citigroup and other institutions with
significant current funding capacity and significant liquidity support,
including the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). See ""TARP and Other
Regulatory Programs"" above. Long-term debt at
June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 includes $24.2 billion and
$24.1 billion, respectively, of junior subordinated debt. The Company
formed statutory business trusts under the laws of the state of Delaware. The
trusts exist for the exclusive purposes of (1) issuing trust securities
representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust;
(2) investing the gross proceeds of the trust securities in junior
subordinated deferrable interest debentures (subordinated debentures) of its
parent; and (3) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental
thereto. Upon approval from the Federal Reserve Board, Citigroup has the right
to redeem these securities. Citigroup has
contractually agreed not to redeem or purchase (i) the 6.50% Enhanced Trust
Preferred Securities of Citigroup Capital XV before September 15, 2056,
(ii) the 6.45% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities of Citigroup
Capital XVI before December 31, 2046, (iii) the
6.35% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities of Citigroup Capital XVII before

of Credit Long-Term Debt In March 2009, SCE issued
$500 million of 6.05% and $250 million of 4.15% first and refunding
mortgage bonds due in 2039 and 2014, respectively. The bond proceeds were used
for general corporate purposes and to finance fuel inventories. In February 2009, SCE repaid
$150 million of its first and refunding mortgage bonds. In March 2009, SCE
purchased two issues of its tax-exempt pollution control bonds totaling
$219 million and converted the issues to a variable rate structure. SCE
continues to hold the bonds which remain outstanding and have not been retired
or cancelled. In June 2009, EME completed through
its subsidiary, Viento Funding II, Inc., a non-recourse portfolio financing
of its interests in the Wildorado, San Juan Mesa and Elkhorn Ridge wind
projects. The portfolio financing included a $189 million seven-year term
loan and a $13 million letter of credit facility which replaced project
letters of credit previously issued under the EME corporate credit facility. Short-Term Debt At June 30, 2009, Edison
International (parent) had $77 million of short-term debt outstanding under
its $1.4 billion credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of
0.68%. Credit Agreements On March 17, 2009, SCE entered
into a new $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility, terminating on
March 16, 2010. The additional liquidity provided by the facility will be
used to support SCE's ongoing power procurement-related needs. In June 2009, SCE amended its
$2.5 billion five-year credit facility, reducing the commitment to
$2.4 billion, and Edison International amended its $1.5 billion
revolving credit facility, reducing the commitment to $1.4 billion. Both
amendments were made to remove a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holding as a
lender. The following table summarizes the

Committed credit available under our five-year revolving credit
facility maturing in December 2012 provides the ability to issue
our commercial paper obligations on a long-term basis. Therefore,
at June 30, 2009, as we had both the ability and intent to
refinance these obligations on a long-term basis, our commercial
paper borrowings were classified as long-term on the consolidated
balance sheets. Commercial paper borrowings as of June 30,
2009, had an average interest rate of 0.75%. On January 13, 2009, we
entered into a $350 million 364-day revolving committed credit
agreement maturing in January 2010. Borrowings under the credit
agreement accrue interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either
(a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of
(1) the agent’s prime rate, (2) the federal funds
rate plus 1/2
of 1% or (3) the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.00%; or
(b) LIBOR plus 2.25%. The margin over LIBOR is variable and is
determined based on our credit rating. Among other restrictions,
the terms of the credit agreement include negative covenants
related to liens and a financial covenant related to the debt-
to-earnings ratio. We now have combined committed bank lines of
$950 million, including a $600 million, five-year revolving credit
facility that matures in December 2012. "

In June 2009, the Company repurchased $1.0 million in principal amount of 7% senior subordinated notes due 2013 at 97% of par value. (2)
In February 2009, the Company issued $600 million in principal amount of 81/2% senior notes due 2014 at 95.15% of par for proceeds of $559.8 million (net of related initial purchaser discounts) and used the net proceeds to pay down outstanding balances on the Company's U.S. credit facility. (3)
Represents the unamortized portion of gains realized upon termination of interest rate swaps that were accounted for as fair value hedges. The gains are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the terms of the notes. Bank Credit Facilities Effective as of
March 16, 2009, Forest entered into the Second Amendment (the ""Second
Amendment"") to its second amended and restated combined credit agreements dated
as of June 6, 2007 that amended certain definitions and covenants of the
credit agreements, including the total debt outstanding-to-EBITDA ratio. The
second amended and restated combined credit agreements consist of a
$1.65 billion U.S. credit facility (the ""U.S. Facility"") with a syndicate
of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and a $150 million Canadian
credit facility (the ""Canadian Facility,"" and together with the U.S. Facility,
the ""Credit Facilities"") with a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., Toronto Branch. The Credit Facilities will mature in June 2012. Forest's availability
under the Credit Facilities is governed by a borrowing base (the ""Global
Borrowing Base""). As a result of issuing $600 million of
81/2% senior notes due 2014 in February 2009, Forest's
borrowing base was lowered from $1.8 billion to $1.62 billion
effective February 17, 2009. As a result of the adjustment to the Global
Borrowing Base, Forest reallocated amounts under the U.S. Facility and Canadian
Facility and currently has allocated $1.47 billion to the U.S. Facility and
$150 million to the Canadian Facility. On March 16, 2009, Forest
announced that its bank group reaffirmed Forest's $1.62 billion Global
Borrowing Base and $1.8 billion nominal amount related to the Credit
Facilities. The next redetermination of the borrowing base is scheduled to be in
the fourth quarter of 2009. At June 30, 2009,
there were outstanding borrowings of $550.0 million under the U.S. Facility
at a weighted average interest rate of 1.4%, and there were outstanding
borrowings of $135.0 million under the Canadian Facility at a weighted
average interest rate of 2.0%. The Company also had used the Credit Facilities
for $2.8 million in letters of credit, leaving an unused borrowing amount
under the Credit Facilities of $932.3 million at June 30, 2009. 81/2%
Senior Notes Due 2014 On February 17,
2009, Forest issued $600 million in principal amount of
81/2% senior notes due 2014 (the
""81/2% Notes"") at 95.15% of par for net proceeds of
$559.8 million, after deducting initial purchaser discounts. Proceeds from
the 81/2% Notes were used to pay down outstanding
balances on the Company's U.S. Facility. The 81/2%
Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Forest Oil Permian Corporation, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest, on an unsecured basis. Interest is payable on
February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning August 15,
2009. The 81/2% Notes will mature on February 15,
2014. Forest may redeem up to 35% of the 81/2% Notes
at any time prior to February 15, 2012, on one or more occasions, with the
proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 108.5% of
the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest. Forest may also redeem
the 81/2% Notes in whole or in part and at any time,
at a ""make-whole"" redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the
principal amount of the 81/2% Notes to be redeemed or
(ii) the sum of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest
on the 81/2% Notes discounted to the date of
redemption at an applicable Treasury yield rate plus 0.50%, plus, in either
case, accrued but unpaid interest. 7% Senior Subordinated Notes
Due 2013 On June 19, 2009,
Forest repurchased $1.0 million in principal amount of 7% senior
subordinated notes due 2013 at 97% of par value. "

269,271 At
June 30, 2009, current debt consisted of commercial paper with
a total face value of $1.4 million that was issued at a
weighted-average annualized interest rate of 0.40% and matures
during the quarter ending September 30, 2009.
The
banking/finance segment has financed its automobile lending
business primarily through Federal Home Loan Bank advances
(“FHLB advances”), securitizations and the issuance of
variable funding notes under one-year revolving variable funding
note warehouse credit facilities. The Company terminated the
warehouse credit facilities in November 2008 and does not currently
intend to replace them. The variable funding notes issued under
these facilities were secured by cash and a pool of automobile
loans that met certain eligibility requirements (see Note 8 –
Securitization of Loans Held for Sale). At
June 30, 2009, the banking/finance segment had $95.0 million
of total outstanding FHLB advances. Approximately $53.0 million of
these advances mature by June 30, 2010, while the remaining
$42.0 million mature from July 2010 through January 2039. These
advances had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.07% at
June 30, 2009 and are subject to collateralization
requirements.
Long-term
debt primarily relates to deferred commission liabilities
recognized in relation to deferred commission assets
(“DCA”) generated in the United States that were
originally financed through a sale of related future revenue to
Lightning Finance Company Limited (“LFL”), a company in
which the Company holds a 49% ownership interest. In December 2005,
LFL transferred substantially all of its rights to this future
revenue to Lightning Asset Finance Limited (“LAFL”), an
Irish special purpose vehicle formed in December 2005, in which the
Company also holds a 49% ownership interest. The holder of the 51%
ownership interests in both LFL and LAFL is a subsidiary of an
international banking institution, which is not affiliated with the
Company. Due to its significant interest in LAFL, the Company
continues to carry on its balance sheet the DCA and the financing
liability related to the future revenue originally sold to LFL by
Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc. until these assets are
amortized or sold by LAFL.
At
June 30, 2009, the Company had $420.0 million in short-term
revolving credit available under a five-year credit facility with
certain banks and financial institutions expiring on June 9,
2010, $498.6 million of short-term commercial paper remaining
available for issuance under an uncommitted $500.0 million private
placement program, and $12.9 million available in uncommitted
short-term bank lines of credit. The revolving credit facility
supports certain of the Company’s commercial paper borrowing
arrangements and is subject to various financial covenants,
including, but not limited to, minimum requirements related to its
interest coverage ratio and maintenance of working capital as well
as limitations on its capitalization ratio, indebtedness,
investments and liens. Interest rates on loans under the revolving
credit facility are determined at the time of issuance and depend
on the type of loan issued. As of June 30, 2009, there were no
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and the
Company was in compliance with the financial covenants related to
this facility.
In addition,
at June 30, 2009, the banking/finance segment had $295.0
million available in uncommitted short-term bank lines of credit
under the Federal Reserve system, $247.7 million available in
secured Federal Reserve Bank short-term discount window and $31.4
million available in secured FHLB short-term borrowing capacity
(see Note 6 – Investments). At June 30, 2009 and
September 30, 2008, loans receivable with aggregate carrying
values of $28.2 million and $22.3 million were pledged as
collateral for the ability to obtain FHLB advances. "

9,2009-08-07,96223,XBRL," 15. Indebtedness In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the Company, from time to time, to purchase its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, depend upon prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements and other factors; such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice. During 2009, the Company repurchased an aggregate $35,600,000 principal amount of its 7% Senior Notes due 2013 and recognized pre-tax gains of $700,000 and $6,000,000 for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009, respectively, which are reflected in investment and other income. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company issued 5,185,807 common shares upon the conversion of $119,101,000 principal amount of the Company’s 33/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, pursuant to privately negotiated transactions to induce conversion. The number of common shares issued was in accordance with the terms of the notes; however, the Company paid the former noteholders $25,000,000 in addition to the shares. The additional cash payments were recorded as selling, general and other expenses. Debt due within one year includes $168,800,000 and $151,100,000 as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, relating to repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2009, these fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 0.5%, mature at various dates through September 2009 and are collateralized by non-current investments with a carrying value of $180,600,000. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company’s real estate subsidiary MB1 received several notices of default with respect to $100,400,000 of nonrecourse indebtedness that is collateralized by its real estate project. The lenders did not seek to accelerate payment of the debt obligation. The contractual maturity of the debt obligation is October 2009, and as such has been classified as a current liability as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. If MB1 is unable to make debt service or principal payments on the loan the Company is under no obligation to make those payments. In June 2009, the Company terminated its $100,000,000 bank credit facility; no amounts were outstanding under this facility. "

3,2009-08-07,1043604,XBRL," Note 8. Financing Arrangements The Company has customer financing arrangements to sell its accounts receivable to a major third-party financing provider. The program does not, and is not intended to, affect the timing of revenue recognition because the Company only recognizes revenue upon sell-through. Under the financing arrangements, proceeds from the financing provider are due to the Company 30 days from the sale of the receivable. In these transactions with the financing provider, the Company has surrendered control over the transferred assets. The accounts receivable have been isolated from the Company and put beyond the reach of creditors, even in the event of bankruptcy. The Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through obligations or rights to redeem, transfer, or repurchase the receivables after they have been transferred. Pursuant to the receivable financing arrangements for the sale of receivables, the Company sold net receivables of $81.1 million and $108.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and $172.3 million and $167.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009, and 2008, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2009, and 2008, the Company received cash proceeds of $80.2 million and $77.8 million, respectively, and $175.7 million and $132.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009, and 2008, respectively, from the financing provider. The amount owed by the financing provider recorded as accounts receivable on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, was $66.7 million and $73.9 million, respectively. The portion of the receivable financed that has not been recognized as revenue is accounted for as a financing pursuant to FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 88-18, Sales of Future Revenues. As of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the estimated amounts of cash received from the financing provider that has not been recognized as revenue were $27.9 million and $33.0 million, respectively.

4,2009-08-07,890801,XBRL," 8. Credit Facilities On December 22, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions (“the Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a $100.0 million unsecured term loan and a $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a $25.0 million letter of credit sublimit. The Credit Facility also contains an expansion option permitting us to arrange up to an aggregate of $200.0 million in additional commitments from existing lenders and/or new lenders at the lenders’ discretion. In January 2009, we borrowed $100.0 million against the term loan in the Credit Facility. The principal together with any accrued interest on the term loan is due on December 22, 2009. Loans may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros or other currencies agreed to by the lenders. Loans will bear interest at our election at the prime rate or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin (ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%) that varies with our consolidated leverage ratio (a “eurocurrency loan”). Our interest rate was 2.3% as of June 30, 2009. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to prime rate loans and at the end of an interest period (or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months) in the case of eurocurrency loans. Commitment fees range from 0.25% to 0.45% of the unused portion on the credit facility depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. The credit facility, which is subject to certain quarterly financial covenants, terminates on December 22, 2011, on which date all outstanding principal of, together with accrued interest on, any revolving loans will be due. We may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs in the case of eurocurrency loans. In addition, we have a 14 million Euro credit facility with a bank (“the Euro Credit Facility”). The Euro Credit Facility is available on an offering basis, meaning that transactions under the Euro Credit Facility will be on such terms and conditions, including interest rate, maturity, representations, covenants and events of default, as mutually agreed between us and the bank at the time of each specific transaction. The Euro Credit Facility is intended to be used for short-term credit requirements, with terms of one year or less. The Euro Credit Facility can be canceled at any time. No balances were outstanding under the Euro Credit Facility as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. "

750,789 (Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts in tables are in thousands, except per share data) We have a $600 million unsecured bank credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), which was originally scheduled to mature on March 15, 2012. During the first quarter of 2008, the term of the Credit Facility was extended for an additional one-year period to March 15, 2013. During this one-year extension period, the total amount available under the Credit Facility will be $575 million, but we have the right to seek an increase of the total amount available during that period to $600 million. We may, subject to certain conditions, request that the term of the Credit Facility be further extended for an additional one-year period. Our subsidiary, Noble Drilling Corporation (“Noble Drilling”), has guaranteed the obligations under the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect to increase the amount available up to $800 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest (i) at the sum of Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Facility; 0.235 percent based on our current credit ratings), or (ii) at the base rate, determined as the greater of the prime rate for U.S. Dollar loans announced by Citibank, N.A. in New York or the sum of the weighted average overnight federal funds rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50 percent. The Credit Facility contains various covenants, including a debt to total tangible capitalization covenant that limits this ratio to 0.60. As of June 30, 2009, our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization was 0.11. In addition, the Credit Facility includes restrictions on certain fundamental changes such as mergers, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the Credit Facility, and the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets unless to a subsidiary. The Credit Facility also limits our subsidiaries’ additional indebtedness, excluding intercompany advances and loans, to 10 percent of our consolidated net assets, as defined in the Credit Facility, unless a subsidiary guarantee is issued to the parent company borrower. There are also restrictions on our incurring or assuming additional liens in certain circumstances. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility at June 30, 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, we repaid $150 million principal amount of 6.95% Senior Notes due 2009 and $23 million principal amount of project financing Thompson Notes using cash on hand at maturity. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value as used in SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, represents the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.

Liberty paid $187.5 million (of which $37.5 million was existing cash collateral) to retire $400 million face amount of its 4% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2029 and $350 million face amount of its 33/4% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2030. Liberty also terminated swap arrangements that reference the 4% and 33/4% Exchangeable Senior Debentures with no additional payment. Including this payment, the total cash used to retire the $750 million face amount of Exchangeable Senior Debentures and swaps referencing these Exchangeable Senior Debentures was $503 million, of which $315 million was paid to settle swap arrangements that were settled in November 2008. In addition, in the second quarter of 2009, Liberty purchased and retired $117 million principal amount of its 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures for aggregate cash payments of $99 million. Liberty Derivative Loan During the first quarter of 2009, Liberty made additional net borrowings of $1,638 million against the present value of its Sprint derivatives. Such debt is due when the derivatives expire in 2009 and 2010 and is expected to be retired by the offset of debt left against amounts to be received by Liberty upon expiration of the derivatives. In this regard, in the second quarter of 2009, Liberty repaid $333 million of the Sprint derivative loan with cash on hand. Subsequent to June 30, 2009, a Sprint derivative expired, and Liberty received cash proceeds of $354 million. QVC Bank Credit Facilities Effective June 16, 2009, QVC amended each of its bank credit agreements (the ""Amended Credit Agreements""). Concurrent with the execution of the Amended Credit Agreements, QVC retired $750 million of loans at par and cancelled another $19 million of unfunded commitments at no cost, with the remaining $4.48 billion outstanding principal to mature in six tranches between June 2010 and March 2014 as follows: $500 million due in 2010; $702 million due in 2011; $400 million due in 2012; $400 million due in 2013; and $2,475 million due in 2014. In connection with the execution of the Amended Credit Agreements, those lenders consenting to the amendments, which hold loans in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $4.23 billion, received certain modified loan terms, including (i) adjusted interest rate margins of 350 to 550 basis points depending on the tranche maturity, (ii) reductions in QVC's maximum leverage ratio, (iii) additional restrictions on creating additional indebtedness and (iv) mandatory prepayment in the event of certain asset sales by QVC. Loans held by the non-consenting lenders, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $252 million, will continue to receive an interest rate margin of up to 100 basis points with their loans maturing in 2011. All other terms of the Amended Credit Agreements will apply to these loans. Cash used to retire the $750 million of loans came from a combination of $250 million in cash from QVC and $250 million in the form of an intergroup loan from each of the Entertainment Group and the Capital Group to the Interactive Group. Such intergroup loans (i) are secured by various public stocks attributed to the Interactive Group, (ii) accrue interest quarterly at the rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points and (iii) are due June 16, 2010. QVC was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at June 30, 2009. QVC Interest Rate Swap Arrangements QVC is party to ten separate interest rate swap arrangements with an aggregate notional amount of $2,200 million to manage the cash flow risk associated with interest payments on its variable rate debt. The swap arrangements provide for QVC to make fixed payments at rates ranging from 4.9575% to 5.2928% and to receive variable payments at 3 month LIBOR. All of the swap arrangements expire in March 2011. Until December 2008, Liberty accounted for the swap arrangements as cash flow hedges with the effective portions of changes in the fair value reflected in other comprehensive earnings in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. In December 2008, QVC elected interest terms under its credit facilities that do not effectively match the terms of the swap arrangements. As a result, the swaps no longer qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement No. 133. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swaps are now reflected in realized and unrealized gains or losses on financial instruments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. QVC is also party to two interest rate swap arrangements with an aggregate notional amount of $600 million. These swap arrangements, which expire in October 2010, provide for QVC to make fixed payments at 3.07% and to receive variable payments at 3 month LIBOR. These swap arrangements do not qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement 133. DIRECTV Collar Loan In April 2008, Liberty entered into an equity collar (the ""DIRECTV Collar"") with respect to 110 million shares of DIRECTV common stock and a related credit facility (the ""Collar Loan"") against the present value of the put value of such collar. At the time of closing, Liberty borrowed $1,977 million. The Collar Loan is due as the DIRECTV Collar terminates in six tranches from June 2009 through August 2012. Each tranche is repayable during a six-month period based upon a formula that factors in several variables including the market price of DIRECTV common stock. Interest accrues at an effective weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and is due and payable as each tranche matures. Borrowings are collateralized by the puts underlying the Collar Loan and 170 million shares of DIRECTV common stock owned by Liberty. In November 2008, Liberty chose to unwind 50% of the first tranche of the DIRECTV Collar. The first tranche expires in 2009 and originally had 22.5 million DIRECTV shares underlying it. As part of this transaction, Liberty repaid the portion of the Collar Loan ($228.4 million) associated with the shares that were unwound. Such repayment was funded with (1) proceeds from the collar unwind ($45.5 million), (2) funds borrowed from the remaining capacity of the Collar Loan ($181.1 million) and (3) cash on hand ($1.8 million). As a result of this transaction, the amount of the Collar Loan due in 2009 is approximately $258 million including accrued interest. The DIRECTV Collar contains a provision that allows the counterparty to terminate a portion of the DIRECTV Collar if the total number of shares of DIRECTV underlying the DIRECTV Collar exceeds 20% of the outstanding public float of DIRECTV common stock. In the event the counterparty chooses to terminate a portion of the DIRECTV Collar, the repayment of the corresponding debt would be accelerated. As of June 30, 2009, the number of shares of DIRECTV common stock underlying the DIRECTV Collar represented approximately 22% of the outstanding public float of DIRECTV common stock. As of such date, the counterparty had not elected to terminate a portion of the collar. Other Subsidiary Debt Other subsidiary debt at June 30, 2009 is comprised of capitalized satellite transponder lease obligations and bank debt of certain subsidiaries. Fair Value of Debt Liberty estimates the fair value of its debt based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rate offered to Liberty for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of Liberty's publicly traded debt securities that are not reported at fair value in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2009 is as follows (amounts in millions): Fixed rate senior notes $ 816 Senior debentures $ 572 Due to the low risk nature of the Collar Loan, Liberty believes that the carrying amount approximates fair value. Due to its variable rate nature, Liberty believes that the carrying amount of its subsidiary debt and other parent debt approximated fair value at June 30, 2009. "

borrowers entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). At
June 30, 2009, the Agreement included a $900.0 million revolving credit
facility, a 225.0 million Australian dollar term loan, and a 110.8 million
Canadian dollar term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of
June 15, 2012. It also included a $191.5 million term loan and a
191.5 million term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of
June 14, 2013. As a result of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, the Company believes that the
maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility was reduced by
$32.3 million. After further deducting amounts attributable to letters of
credit and overdraft facilities that are supported by the revolving credit
facility, at June 30, 2009 the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused
credit of $799.4 million available under the Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings
outstanding under the Agreement at June 30, 2009 was 2.57%. During May 2009, a subsidiary of the Company
issued senior notes with a face value of $600.0 million issued at 96.72% of face
value for an effective interest rate of 8.00%. The notes bear interest at
7.375% and are due May 15, 2016. The notes are guaranteed by
substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The net
proceeds, after deducting commissions and expenses from the notes, approximated
$568 million and were used to purchase in a tender offer $221.9 million of the
$250 million principal amount of 7.50% Senior Debentures due May 2010 and
to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The balance of
the proceeds increased cash. As a part of the issuance of these notes and
the related tender offer, the Company recorded in the second quarter of 2009
additional interest charges of $5.2 million for note repurchase premiums and the
related write-off of unamortized finance fees, net of a gain from the
termination of the interest rate swap agreement on the notes. During October 2006, the Company entered into
a 300 million European accounts receivable securitization program. The
program extends through October 2011, subject to annual renewal of backup
credit lines. In addition, the Company participates in a receivables
financing program in the Asia Pacific region with a revolving funding commitment
of 85 million Australian dollars and 25 million New Zealand dollars that expire
January 2010 and October 2009, respectively. Information related to the Companys accounts
receivable securitization programs is as follows: June 30, Dec. 31, June 30, 2009 2008 2008 Balance (included in short-term loans) $ 289.5 $ 293.7 $ 437.9 Weighted average interest rate 2.18 % 5.31 % 5.72 % Effective for the second quarter of 2009, the Company adopted the
provisions of FASB Staff Position on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 107 and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28, Interim
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP FAS
No. 107-1and APB 28-1). FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1 requires
disclosure about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting
periods as well as in annual financial statements. The carrying amounts reported for the accounts
receivable securitization programs, and certain long-term debt obligations
subject to frequently redetermined interest rates, approximate fair value. Fair values for the Companys significant fixed rate debt obligations are
generally based on published market quotations. Fair values at June 30, 2009, of the
Companys significant fixed rate debt obligations were as follows: Principal Amount Indicated Fair Value (millions of Market (millions of dollars) Price dollars) Senior Notes: 8.25%, due 2013 $ 450.0 101.25 $ 455.6 6.75%, due 2014 400.0 94.25 377.0 6.75%, due 2014 (225 million) 317.8 90.63 288.0 7.375%, due 2016 600.0 96.13 576.8 6.875%, due 2017 (300 million) 423.7 88.13 373.4 Senior Debentures: 7.50%, due 2010 28.1 100.80 28.3 7.80%, due 2018 250.0 94.50 236.3 "

following (in millions): June 30, December 31, 2009 2008 Short-term debt: Senior secured hedged inventory facility bearing interest at a rate of 2.1% and 2.3% at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively $ 436 $ 280 Senior unsecured revolving credit facility, bearing interest at a rate of 0.8% and 1.1% at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively (1) 325 746 Senior notes, net of unamortized discount (2) (3) 175  Other 2 1 Total short-term debt 938 1,027 Long-term debt: Long-term debt under senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other (1) 4 40 Senior notes, net of unamortized net premium and discount 3,394 3,219 Total long-term debt (1) (3) 3,398 3,259 Total debt $ 4,336 $ 4,286 (1) At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
we have classified $325 million and $746 million, respectively, of borrowings
under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility as short-term. These
borrowings are designated as working capital borrowings, must be repaid within
one year and are primarily for hedged LPG and crude oil inventory and New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) margin
deposits. (2) Our $175 million 4.75% senior notes will mature
on August 15, 2009 (see discussion of the issuance of our $350 million 8.75%
senior notes below). (3) We estimate the aggregate fair value of our
fixed-rate senior notes at June 30, 2009 to be approximately $3,550
million. Our fixed-rate senior notes are traded among institutions, which
trades are routinely published by a reporting service. Our determination
of fair value is based on reported trading activity near quarter end. In July 2009, we
completed the issuance of $500 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due
September 1, 2012. The senior notes were sold at 99.802% of face
value. Interest payments are due on March 1 and September 1 of
each year, beginning on March 1, 2010. We used the net proceeds from
this offering to supplement the capital available under our existing hedged
inventory facility to fund working capital needs associated with base levels of
routine foreign crude oil import and for seasonal LPG inventory
requirements. Concurrent with the issuance of these Senior Notes, we
entered into interest rate swaps whereby we receive fixed payments at 4.25% and
pay three-month LIBOR plus a spread on a notional principal amount of $150
million maturing in two years and an additional $150 million notional principal
amount maturing in three years. In April 2009, we
completed the issuance of $350 million of 8.75% Senior Notes due May 1,
2019. The senior notes were sold at 99.994% of face value. Interest
payments are due on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on
November 1, 2009. We used the net proceeds from this offering to
reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities, which may be
reborrowed to fund future investments and for general partnership purposes,
including repayment of our $175 million 4.75% senior notes that mature in August
2009. Letters of Credit In connection with our
crude oil marketing, we provide certain suppliers with irrevocable standby
letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of crude oil. At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of
credit of approximately $51 million and $51 million, respectively. "

7,198.5 Revolving Credit Facilities Our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility due April 2012 and the $1.75 billion revolving credit facility due September 2013 (collectively, the Credit Facilities) bear interest at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, both terms defined in the agreements, plus an applicable margin based on our Debt Ratings, also a term defined in the agreements. As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the interest rate for our borrowings under our Credit Facilities was 1.98% and 3.43%, respectively. The Credit Facilities are also subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments, regardless of usage. At June 30, 2009, we had $350.0 million of Eurodollar Rate borrowings, $38.0 million of Base Rate borrowings and $1,631.8 million of revolver capacity which was used to support outstanding of letters of credit, leaving $730.1 million of available liquidity under the Credit Facilities. The agreements governing the Credit Facilities require us to maintain certain financial and other covenants. We have the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in compliance with these covenants. At June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facilities. Proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Facilities are being used for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. Receivables Secured Loans We have an accounts receivable securitization program with two financial institutions that allows us to borrow up to $300.0 million on a revolving basis under loan agreements secured by receivables. On May 28, 2009, we renewed the facility and reduced the borrowing capacity from $400.0 million to $300.0 million. The agreements include a 364-day liquidity facility secured by receivables that matures on May 28, 2010. If we are unable to renew the liquidity facility when it matures on May 28, 2010, we will refinance any amounts outstanding with our Credit Facilities or with other long-term borrowings. Although we intend to renew the liquidity facility no later than May 28, 2010 and do not expect to repay the amounts within the next twelve months, the loan is classified as current because it has a contractual maturity of less than one year. The borrowings are secured by our accounts receivable. These receivables are held in and owned by a wholly owned and fully consolidated subsidiary. This subsidiary is a separate corporate entity whose assets, or collateral securing the borrowings, are available first to satisfy the claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. At June 30, 2009, the total amount of accounts receivable (gross) serving as collateral securing the borrowing was $449.1 million. Under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities — a Replacement of FASB Statement 125, the securitization program is accounted for as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral. The receivables and debt obligation remain on our consolidated balance sheet. The borrowings under this program bear interest at the financial institutions’ commercial paper rate plus an applicable spread and interest is payable monthly. Senior Notes and Debentures As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, our senior notes and debentures totaled $4,914.7 million and $4,985.9 million, net of unamortized discounts and premiums of $27.2 million and $27.5 million, remaining unamortized adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for the acquisition of Allied of $759.5 million and $809.8 million, and adjustments to fair value related to our interest rate swap agreements of $11.8 million and $15.1 million, respectively. Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures Our $230.0 million of 4.25% unsecured senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2034 are convertible into 5.2 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $44.17 per share. These debentures are convertible at the option of the holder anytime if certain conditions occur, as outlined in the agreement. We can elect to settle the conversion in stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash. We can elect to call the debentures at any time after April 15, 2009 at par for cash only. The holders can require us to redeem some or all of the debentures on April 15th of 2011, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029 at par for stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash at our option. If the debentures are redeemed in stock, the number of shares issued will be determined at the par value of the debentures divided by the average trading stock price of the preceding five-day period. At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the unamortized adjustment to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for these debentures was $22.2 million and $28.7 million, respectively, which is being amortized to interest expense through April 15, 2011, the first date that the holders can require us to redeem the debentures. Tax-Exempt Financings As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had $1,142.8 million and $1,308.2 million, respectively, of fixed and variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2037. Approximately two-thirds of our tax-exempt financings are remarketed weekly or daily, by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. These variable rate tax-exempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with credit ratings of A or better. The holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period. As of June 30, 2009, we had $259.3 million of restricted cash and marketable securities, of which $117.8 million were proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings, and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. Restricted cash also includes amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance. Other Debt Other debt primarily includes capital lease liabilities of $140.8 million and $139.5 million as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, with maturities ranging from 2009 to 2042. Fair Value of Debt The fair value of our fixed rate senior notes using quoted market rates is $5.4 billion and $5.2 billion at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The carrying value of our fixed rate senior notes is $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The carrying amounts of our remaining notes payable and tax-exempt financings approximate fair value because interest rates are variable and, accordingly, approximate current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change. For active hedge arrangements, the fair value of the derivatives is included in the consolidated balance sheets. Guarantees Substantially all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the Credit Facilities. We and substantially all of our subsidiaries (including substantially all of the subsidiaries of Allied) guarantee nine series of senior notes issued by Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA), a subsidiary of Allied (the AWNA Senior Notes). The guarantees of the AWNA Senior Notes by our subsidiaries (other than the guarantee by Allied) would be automatically released upon the release of such subsidiaries from their guarantee obligations under the Credit Facilities. We and substantially all our subsidiaries (including substantially all of the subsidiaries of Allied) also guarantee the 9.25% debentures due 2021 and the 7.40% debentures due 2035 issued by Browning-Ferris Industries, LLC (successor to Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.) (BFI), another subsidiary of Allied (the BFI Debentures). The guarantees of the BFI Debentures by our subsidiaries (other than the guarantees by Allied and AWNA) would be automatically released upon the release of such subsidiaries from their guarantee obligations under the Credit Facilities. Substantially all of our subsidiaries (including Allied and substantially all of its subsidiaries) have guaranteed our 6.75% senior notes due 2011 and our 6.086% senior notes due 2035 (the Republic Senior Notes). The guarantees of the Republic Senior Notes by our subsidiaries would be automatically released upon the release of such subsidiaries from their guarantee obligations under the Credit Facilities. We have guaranteed some of the tax-exempt bonds of our subsidiaries. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations associated with tax-exempt bonds as they come due, we will be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No additional liability has been recorded for these guarantees because the underlying obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest Paid Interest paid was $234.4 million and $43.7 million (net of capitalized interest of $1.8 million and $1.0 million) for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 includes $73.9 million of accretion expense of which, $50.6 million is non-cash interest expense on debt primarily related to amortizing the discount to fair value recorded for the debt we acquired from Allied. This accretion expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 also includes $23.3 million of accretion expense associated with discounts recorded on the environmental and self-insurance reserves we acquired from Allied. Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have managed risk associated with executing this strategy, particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. We also entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The swap agreements have a total notional value of $210.0 million and mature in August 2011. This maturity is identical to our senior notes that also mature in 2011. Under the swap agreements, we pay interest at floating rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6.75%. We have designated these agreements as hedges in changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and account for them in accordance with SFAS 133. We have determined that these agreements qualify for the short-cut method under SFAS 133 and, therefore, changes in the fair value of the agreements are assumed to be perfectly effective in hedging changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates. As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, interest rate swap agreements are reflected at their fair value of $11.8 million and $15.1 million, respectively, and are included in other assets and as an adjustment to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes the impact of changes in the fair value of our derivatives and the underlying hedged items on our results of operations for the six months ended June, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): Consolidated Statement of Gain (Loss) on Swap Gain (Loss) on Fixed-Rate Debt Income Classification Three and Six Months Ended June 30, Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Interest Expense $

$500 million of 6.05% and $250 million of 4.15% first and refunding
mortgage bonds due in 2039 and 2014, respectively. The bond proceeds were used
for general corporate purposes and to finance fuel inventories. In February 2009, SCE repaid
$150 million of its first and refunding mortgage bonds. In March 2009, SCE
purchased two issues of its tax-exempt pollution control bonds totaling
$219 million and converted the issues to a variable rate structure. SCE
continues to hold the bonds which remain outstanding and have not been retired
or cancelled. Credit Agreements On March 17, 2009, SCE entered
into a new $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility, terminating on
March 16, 2010. The additional liquidity provided by the facility will be
used to support SCE's ongoing power procurement-related needs. In June 2009, SCE amended its
$2.5 billion five-year credit facility to remove a subsidiary of Lehman
Brothers Holding as a lender which resulted in a reduction of the total

Net proceeds of $991.1 million were received in connection with the offering and were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under a $1.0 billion bridge loan facility expiring August 2009. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company, carry a combined effective interest rate of 9.44 percent and require semi-annual interest payments. In March 2009, the Company also entered into a $525.0 million term loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions (the “Lenders”) which remained undrawn at June 30, 2009. Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company requested termination of the term loan facility and entered into a new $375.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with the Lenders. The revolving credit agreement allows for the election of interest at a base rate, or a Eurodollar rate of LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and requires the payment of a quarterly commitment fee of 32.5 basis points on the unutilized portion of the facility. The credit agreement, which contains a debt-to-total capitalization limitation and other customary covenants, expires on July 23, 2010.

DEBT Commercial
Paper Prudential Financial has a
commercial paper program rated A-1 by Standard &
Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”), P-2 by
Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”)
and F2 by Fitch Ratings Ltd. (“Fitch”) as of
June 30, 2009. Prudential Financial’s outstanding
commercial paper borrowings were $505 million and $1,243 million as
of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. Prudential Funding, LLC, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, has a commercial
paper program, rated A-1+ by S&P, P-1 by Moody’s and F1
by Fitch as of June 30, 2009. Prudential Funding’s
outstanding commercial paper and master note borrowings were $1,718
million and $4,354 million as of June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. Prudential Financial has
issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Funding’s
domestic commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the weighted average maturity of the total
commercial paper outstanding was 32 and 29 days,
respectively. Both Prudential
Financial’s and Prudential Funding’s commercial paper
programs were granted approval during the fourth quarter of 2008 to
participate in the Commercial Paper Funding Facility
(“CPFF”) sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Commercial paper programs must maintain ratings of at least
A-1/P-1/F1 by at least two rating agencies in order to be eligible
for the CPFF. As of June 30, 2009, neither Prudential
Financial nor Prudential Funding had any commercial paper
outstanding under the CPFF. On February 19, 2009, the
commercial paper credit rating of Prudential Financial was
downgraded by Fitch from F1 to F2. Consequently, as of that date,
Prudential Financial became ineligible to issue commercial paper
under the CPFF. Prudential Funding continues to be eligible based
on its current credit ratings to sell to the CPFF three-month
unsecured U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper up to a maximum
of $9.815 billion, less the outstanding amount of any non-CPFF
commercial paper at any applicable time. Access to the CPFF for the
issuance of new commercial paper is scheduled to terminate on
February 1, 2010, unless such date is extended by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. Convertible Senior
Notes On December 12, 2007,
Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $3.0 billion of
floating rate convertible senior notes that are convertible by the
holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of
Prudential Financial’s Common Stock. The conversion price,
$132.39 per share, is subject to adjustment upon certain corporate
events. The conversion feature requires net settlement in shares;
therefore, upon conversion, a holder would receive cash up to the
par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and
shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock only for the portion of
the settlement amount in excess of the par amount, if any. These
notes are redeemable by Prudential Financial, at par plus accrued
interest, on or after June 16, 2009. Holders of the notes may
also require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par
plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates, of which
the first such date was June 15, 2009. On June 15, 2009,
$1,819 million of these notes were repurchased by Prudential
Financial as required by the holders. The next date on which
holders of these notes may require Prudential Financial to
repurchase these notes is December 15, 2009. Separately,
during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009,
the Company repurchased, in individually negotiated transactions,
$853 million and $245 million, respectively, of these notes which
were offered to the Company by certain holders. These notes were
repurchased at a discount resulting in a pre-tax gain of $7 million
that is recorded within “Asset management fees and other
income.” As of June 30, 2009, $83 million of these
floating rate convertible senior notes remain outstanding. In
addition, as of June 30, 2009, $4 million of floating rate
convertible senior notes that were issued by Prudential Financial
in a private placement in December 2006 remain outstanding. The
next date on which holders of these notes may require Prudential
Financial to repurchase these notes is December 12,
2009. Medium-term
Notes In June 2009, Prudential
Financial issued $250 million of 6.20% medium-term notes due
January 2015 and $750 million of 7.375% medium-term notes due June
2019 under its shelf registration statement. Federal Home Loan Bank of New
York Prudential Insurance has been
a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
(“FHLBNY”) since June 2008. Membership allows
Prudential Insurance access to collateralized advances,
collateralized funding agreements, and other FHLBNY products.
Collateralized advances from the FHLBNY are classified in
“Short-term debt” or “Long-term debt,”
depending on the maturity date of the obligation. Collateralized
funding agreements issued to the FHLBNY are classified in
“Policyholders’ account balances.” These funding
agreements have priority claim status above debt holders of
Prudential Insurance. Prudential Insurance’s
membership in FHLBNY requires the ownership of member stock, and
borrowings from FHLBNY require the purchase of FHLBNY activity
based stock in an amount equal to 4.5% of the
outstanding borrowings. All FHLBNY stock
purchased by Prudential Insurance is classified as restricted
general account investments within “Other long-term
investments,” and the carrying value of these investments was
$221 million as of June 30, 2009. The FHLBNY requires
Prudential Insurance to pledge qualifying mortgage-related assets
or U.S. Treasury securities as collateral for all borrowings. On
May 8, 2009, the New Jersey Department of Banking and
Insurance (“NJDOBI”) revised its prior guidance to
increase the maximum amount of qualifying assets that Prudential
Insurance may pledge as collateral to the FHLBNY from 5% to 7% of
its prior year-end statutory net admitted assets exclusive of
separate account assets; however, this limitation resets to 5% on
December 31, 2010 unless extended by NJDOBI. Based on its
statutory net admitted assets as of December 31, 2008, the 7%
limitation equates to a maximum amount of pledged assets of $10.5
billion and an estimated maximum borrowing capacity, after taking
into account applicable required collateralization levels and
required purchases of activity based FHLBNY stock, of approximately
$9.0 billion. However, the ability to borrow from the FHLBNY is
subject to the availability and maintenance of qualifying assets at
Prudential Insurance, and there is no assurance that Prudential
Insurance will have sufficient qualifying assets available to it in
order to access the increased capacity in full at any particular
time. Also, the revised guidance from NJDOBI limits the aggregate
amount of assets Prudential Insurance may pledge for all loans,
including borrowings from the FHLBNY, to 10% of its prior year-end
statutory net admitted assets exclusive of separate account assets;
however, this limitation excludes certain activities, such as
asset-based financing transactions. The fair value of the
qualifying assets pledged as collateral by Prudential Insurance
must be maintained at certain specified levels of the borrowed
amount, which can vary, depending on the nature of the assets
pledged. As of June 30, 2009, Prudential Insurance had pledged
qualifying assets with a fair value of $7,439 million, which is
above the minimum level required by the FHLBNY, and had total
outstanding borrowings of $3.5 billion. The total borrowings from
the FHLBNY as of June 30, 2009, is comprised of collateralized
advances, of which $1.0 billion is reflected in “Short-term
debt” and $1.0 billion is reflected in “Long-term
debt,” as well as $1.5 billion of collateralized funding
agreements that are reflected in “Policyholders’
account balances.” TALF Borrowings During the first six months
of 2009, the Company purchased securities under the Federal
Reserve’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility
(“TALF”). TALF provides secured financing for
asset-backed securities backed by certain types of consumer and
small business loans and as of July 2009 for certain high-quality
commercial mortgage-backed securities issued before January 1,
2009. TALF financing is non-recourse to the borrower, is
collateralized by the purchased securities and provides financing
for the purchase price of the securities, less a
‘haircut’ that varies based on the type of collateral.
Borrowers under the program can deliver the collateralized
securities to a special purpose vehicle created by the Federal
Reserve in full defeasance of the loan. As of June 30, 2009, the
Company has $1,250 million of securities purchased under TALF that
are reflected within “Other trading account assets,”
and has $1,167 million of secured financing from the Federal
Reserve related to the purchase of these securities that is
reflected within “Long-term debt.” The Company is
carrying the securities at fair value as SFAS No. 115 trading
assets and the loan at fair value under the fair value option
afforded by SFAS No. 159. "

available under the credit facilities. Our credit agreements contain
various financial and other covenants, including the maintenance of
certain financial ratios. Failure to meet those covenants beyond
applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates
and/or termination of the agreements. As of June 30, 2009, we
were in compliance with those covenants. In addition, our credit
agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the
agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the
acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or
some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements
contain material adverse change clauses.

Notes are redeemable by Torchmark in whole or in part at any time
subject to a “make-whole” premium, whereby the Company
would be required to pay the greater of the full principal amount
of the Notes or otherwise the present value of the remaining
repayment schedule of the
Notes discounted at a rate of interest equivalent to the rate of a
United States Treasury security of comparable term plus a spread of
75 basis points. Torchmark intends to use the net proceeds from
this offering to repay its $99 million 8 1/4% Senior Debentures which mature on August 15, 2009
(plus accrued interest) and for other general corporate
purposes. "

7,797 We are authorized to borrow
up to $10.0 billion under the U.S. commercial paper program we
maintain. We had $1.878 billion outstanding under this program as
of June 30, 2009, with an average interest rate of 0.21%. As
of June 30, 2009, we have classified the entire commercial
paper balance as a current liability in our consolidated balance
sheet. As of December 31, 2008, $1.0 billion of commercial
paper was classified as long-term debt in anticipation of the
subsequent issuance of fixed rate notes, as discussed further
below. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under
which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a
variety of currencies, however there were no amounts outstanding
under this program as of June 30, 2009. We maintain two credit
agreements with a consortium of banks. One of these agreements
provides revolving credit facilities of $3.0 billion, and expires
on April 15, 2010. Interest on any amounts we borrow under
this facility would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus a percentage
determined by quotations from Markit Group Ltd. for our 1-year
credit default swap spread, subject to certain minimum rates and
maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. If our public
debt ratings are A / A2 or above, the minimum applicable margin is
1.00% and the maximum applicable margin is 2.00%; if our public
debt ratings are lower than A / A2, the minimum applicable margin
is 1.50% and the maximum applicable margin is 3.00%. The second agreement provides
revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion, and expires on
April 19, 2012. Interest on any amounts we borrow under this
facility would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. At
June 30, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under
either of these facilities. In addition to these credit
facilities, we have an automatically effective registration
statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for
registered offerings of short or long-term debt
securities. In March 2009, we completed
an offering of $1.0 billion of 3.875% senior notes due April 2014
and $1.0 billion of 5.125% senior notes due April 2019. These notes
pay interest semiannually, and we may redeem the notes at any time
by paying the greater of the principal amount or a
“make-whole” amount, plus accrued interest. After
pricing and underwriting discounts, we received a total of $1.989
billion in cash proceeds from the offering. The proceeds from the
offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the
reduction of our outstanding commercial paper balance. Our existing debt instruments
and credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings
triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do
subject us to certain financial covenants. As of June 30, 2009
and for all prior periods, we have satisfied these financial
covenants. These covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness
that we may incur, and limit the amount of attributable debt in
sale-leaseback transactions, to 10% of net tangible assets. As of
June 30, 2009, 10% of net tangible assets is equivalent to
$2.289 billion, however we have no covered sale-leaseback
transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding. Additionally, we
are required to maintain a minimum net worth, as defined, of $5.0
billion on a quarterly basis. As of June 30, 2009, our net
worth, as defined, was equivalent to $12.421 billion. We do not
expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial
condition or liquidity. "

Amended As of June 30, 2009,
borrowings under the 2005 Walter Credit Agreement consisted of a term loan
balance of $138.2 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.59%.
The 2005 Walter Credit Agreement is a secured obligation of the Company and
substantially all of its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. The term loan
requires quarterly principal payments of $0.4 million through
October 3, 2012 at which time the remaining outstanding principal is due.
The revolving credit facility and the term loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 200
and 225 basis points, respectively. The commitment fee on the unused portion of
the revolving facility is 0.4% per year. The revolving credit facility matures
on October 3, 2010. In addition, the 2005 Walter Credit Agreement contains
a reducing revolver commitment feature, where the total available revolver
commitment may not exceed $350.0 million at June 30, 2009,
$300.0 million at September 30, 2009, and $250.0 million at
December 31, 2009. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had
$66.1 million in outstanding stand-by letters of credit, of which
$15.7 million relates to the support letter of credit discussed in
Note 2, and $283.9 million of availability for future borrowings under
the revolving credit facility. Other Debt In 2008, the Company
entered into a financing arrangement and a capital lease arrangement to procure
mining equipment. At June 30, 2009, $29.3 million was outstanding at
an interest rate of 4.06% related to the equipment financing and
$8.4 million was outstanding at an implicit rate of 9.78% related to the
capital lease. In June 2009, the Company entered into a $12.7 million
arrangement to finance the premium payments of its property insurance. The debt
obligation will be repaid in nine monthly installments of $1.4 million
beginning in July 2009 and has an implicit interest rate of 3.9%. As of
June 30, 2009, the full $12.7 million was outstanding. In addition, as
of June 30, 2009, $0.6 million of other debt was outstanding. "

issued $750 million of the Notes due April 1, 2008,
resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately
$733 million after transaction fees of $17 million, which
had been deferred and were included on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets in prepaid expense and other current assets. As of
March 31, 2008, the transaction fees were fully amortized. The
Notes were issued at par, did not bear interest, and were
convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock. Upon
conversion, the Company had the right to deliver cash in lieu of
common stock. During the three months ended
March 31, 2008, $167 million of the Notes were converted
and 8.1 million shares of Yahoo! common stock were issued to
the holders of the Notes. On the maturity date of April 1,
2008, the remaining $583 million of the Notes were converted and
28.5 million shares of Yahoo! common stock were issued to the
holders of the Notes. Effective January 1,
2009, the Company adopted FSP APB 14-1 and accordingly prior
periods have been restated. For convertible debt instruments within
the scope of FSP APB 14-1, the proceeds from the instrument’s
issuance must be allocated between the liability and equity
components in a manner that reflects interest cost based upon the
Company’s borrowing rate at the date of issuance of the
convertible debt for a similar debt instrument without the debt
conversion feature. The borrowing rate was estimated to be 5
percent for the liability component of the Notes. This effective
interest rate was used to calculate the fair value of the Notes
using a present value approach and the accretion of interest
expense over the life of the Notes. Upon adoption of FSP APB
14-1, the Company recorded the change in accounting principle as a
cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings as of January 1, 2007 totaling $69 million which
represented imputed interest, net of taxes, for the period from
issuance to January 1, 2007. The corresponding increase in
additional paid-in capital as of January 1, 2007 was $95
million. Imputed interest, which is net of $66 million in taxes,
recorded over the life of the Notes resulted in a reduction in
retained earnings of $95 million and a corresponding increase in
additional paid-in capital of $95 million as of the maturity
date. The interest expense imputed
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 was nil and
$9 million, respectively, which is included in other income, net on
the condensed consolidated statements of income. There was no
impact on basic net income per share for the three months ended
June 30, 2008. The impact on basic net income per share for
the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $0.01. See
Note 2 — “Basic and Diluted Net Income per
Share Attributable to Yahoo! Inc. Common Stockholders” for
additional information. "

and 2039 Notes
In January
2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes
due in 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $1.0 billion
aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the “2039
Notes”) in a registered offering. The 2019 Notes and 2039
Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.70% and 6.40%,
respectively. The 2019 Notes and 2039 Notes may be redeemed at any
time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal
amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and a “make-whole” amount, as
defined. Upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering
event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a
portion of the 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes at a price equal to
101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest.
The total debt discount on issuance and debt issuance costs were $7
million and $13 million, respectively, and are being amortized over
the lives of the notes.
Convertible notes
Effective
January 1, 2009, we adopted FSP APB 14-1 and, as required by
this new standard, we retrospectively applied this change in
accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable
outstanding convertible debt (see Note 2, “Change in
method of accounting for convertible debt instruments”).
Under this method of accounting, the debt and equity components of
our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately.
The equity components of our convertible notes, including our 2011
Convertible Notes, 2013 Convertible Notes and 2032 Modified
Convertible Notes, are included in “Common stock and
additional paid-in capital” in the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets, with a corresponding reduction in the carrying
values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification, as
applicable. The reduced carrying values of our convertible notes
are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the
recognition of non-cash interest expense. This results in
recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates
approximating what we would have incurred had we issued
nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms.
The 2011
Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par
and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The
discounts associated with these notes resulting from the adoption
of FSP APB 14-1 are being amortized over periods that end on the
scheduled maturity dates of these notes and result in effective
interest rates of approximately 6.24% for the 2011 Convertible
Notes and approximately 6.35% for the 2013 Convertible
Notes.

The 2011

certain conditions, be converted based on a conversion rate of
12.5247 and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal
amount of notes (which represents a conversion price of
approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). Upon
conversion, a holder would receive the conversion value, as
defined, in: (i) cash equal to the lesser of the principal
amount of the note or the conversion value and (ii) shares of
our common stock, cash or a combination of common stock and cash,
at our option, to the extent the conversion value exceeds the
principal amount of the note. As of June 30, 2009, these notes
were not convertible and the principal values exceeded the
conversion values.
The principal
balances, unamortized discounts and net carrying amounts of the

829 The 2032
Modified Convertible Notes were issued in 2005 in exchange for
zero-coupon, 30-year convertible notes that we issued in 2002. Like
the notes for which they were exchanged, no interest is currently
payable on the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes. These notes were
issued at a discount from their principal amount (prior to the
adoption of FSP APB 14-1). The reduced carrying value resulting
from issuing these notes at a discount is being accreted back to
the principal amount based on a contractual interest rate of 1.125%
over the life of the notes. In March 2007, substantially all of the
holders of the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercised their
option to put these convertible notes to us. The additional
discount on the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes recognized pursuant
to the retrospective application of FSP APB 14-1 (in excess of the
discount recognized under the contractual terms of these securities) was amortized
as non-cash interest expense prior to the holders putting these
convertible notes to us. We continue to recognize interest expense
for the amortization of the discount based on the contractual rate
for the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes that remain outstanding.
Such amounts were not material for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2009 and 2008.
Holders of
the remaining outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes may,
subject to certain conditions, convert each of their notes based on
a conversion rate of 8.8601 shares of common stock. The conversion
price per share of the convertible notes as of any day will equal
the accreted value on that day, divided by the conversion rate, or
$87.52, as of June 30, 2009. If converted, the 2032 Modified
Convertible Notes will be settled in cash for an amount equal to
the lesser of the accreted value of the 2032 Modified Convertible
Notes at the conversion date or the conversion value, as defined,
and shares of common stock, if any, to the extent the conversion
value exceeds the amount paid in cash. As of June 30, 2009,
these notes were not convertible and the accreted value exceeded
the amount that would have been received upon conversion. As of
June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the equity component
for the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes was approximately $29
million.
Other facilities
As of
June 30, 2009, we have a $2.3 billion syndicated unsecured
revolving credit facility which matures in November 2012 and is
available for general corporate purposes, or as a liquidity
backstop to our commercial paper program. In late 2008, a
participating financial institution in the credit facility who had
provided $178 million of such commitment declared bankruptcy.
Subsequently, this financial institution, which is a subsidiary of
Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (“Lehman”), was removed
from the credit facility and the aggregate commitment was reduced
to its current level of $2.3 billion. "

1,2009-08-07,1000697,XBRL," 6 Debt In January 2007, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2007 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $500 million term loan facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility. The 2007 Credit Agreement matures on January 11, 2012 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the fact that the Company utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the Company’s intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the respective period end date. The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case plus a credit margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. The 2007 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. As of July 4, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. At July 4, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had a total of $595 million and $500 million, respectively, borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement, of which $500 million was classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets at both dates. As of July 4, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had a total amount available to borrow of $504 million and $599 million, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to these borrowings were 0.78% and 2.43% at July 4, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The Company, and its foreign subsidiaries, also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $87 million and $88 million at July 4, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At July 4, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the related short-term borrowings were $36 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.15% and $36 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.18%, respectively. /*<![CDATA[*/ <!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:""Times New Roman""; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} /*]]>*/ "

DEBT Revolving credit facilities In June 2009, Bunge entered into (i) a syndicated $645
million, 364-day revolving credit agreement (the 364-day credit agreement) and
(ii) a syndicated $1 billion, three-year revolving credit agreement (the
three-year credit agreement and, together with the 364-day credit agreement, the
credit agreements) with a number of lending institutions. The 364-day
credit agreement matures on June 2, 2010 and the three-year credit
agreement matures on June 1, 2012. The credit agreements replaced
(i) the $850 million revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to
mature on November 17, 2009 and (ii) the $850 million revolving credit
agreement that was scheduled to mature on June 29, 2009, each of which was
terminated in accordance with its respective terms on June 3, 2009. Amounts due under the terminated credit agreements on the date of termination
were repaid with the proceeds of its initial borrowings under the credit
agreements. Borrowings under the credit agreements will bear interest at
LIBOR plus the applicable margin (defined below) or the alternate base rate then
in effect plus the applicable margin minus 1.00%. The margin applicable to
either a LIBOR or alternate base rate borrowing will be based on the greater of
(i) a per annum floor rate that varies between 2.00% and 4.50% under the
364-day credit agreement and between 3.00% and 5.50% under the three-year credit
agreement, each based generally on the credit ratings of Bunges senior
long-term unsecured debt and (ii) a per annum rate calculated as a
percentage of the Markit CDX.NA.IG Series 12 five-year credit default swap
index (or successor index thereof) that varies between 85% and 175% each based
generally on the credit ratings of Bunges senior long-term unsecured
debt. Amounts under the credit agreements that remain undrawn are subject
to a commitment fee payable quarterly on the average undrawn portion of the
respective credit agreement at rates ranging from 0.375% to 1.00% under the
364-day credit agreement and from 0.75% to 2.00% under the three-year credit
agreement, each varying based on the credit ratings of Bunges senior long-term
unsecured debt. Senior
notesIn June 2009, Bunge
completed the sale of $600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured
senior notes (senior notes), which bear interest at 8.50% per year. The senior
notes will mature on June 15, 2019. The senior notes were issued by Bunges
100%-owned finance subsidiary, Bunge Limited Finance Corp., and are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by Bunge Limited. Interest on the senior notes
is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year,
commencing in December 2009. Bunge used the net proceeds of this offering,
of approximately $595 million, after deducting underwriters commissions
and offering expenses, to repay outstanding indebtedness. The fair value of Bunges long-term debt is based
on interest rates currently available on comparable maturities to companies with
credit standing similar to Bunge. The carrying amounts and fair value of
long-term debt are as follows: June 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 (US$ in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including current portion $4,215 $4,221 $3,110 $3,034 "

13. Amendment to Credit
Agreement
In February 2009, the Company entered
into a “Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and First
Amendment to Pledge Agreement” (the “Amendment”).
The Amendment amended, among other things, the Company’s
Credit Agreement dated October 31, 2006. The Amendment
provides the Company with additional flexibility to enhance certain
operational and financial aspects of its business, including, among
other things, undertaking an internal corporate realignment of
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. A substantial portion
of the realignment was completed in connection with the execution
of the Amendment. This corporate realignment did not impact the
composition of the Company’s four operating segments. Among
other things, the Amendment provides the Company with the ability
to repurchase and retire, from time to time through December 2010,
up to $25.0 million of its outstanding term debt under its Credit
Agreement. The Amendment did not change the base interest rate,
interest rate spreads, covenants or other key terms of the Credit
Agreement. "

rate of $1.4020 to €1.00 and $1.3919 to €1.00 as of
June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. See Note 2 for information on our related cross
currency swap. (b)
The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may
require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes
at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates
that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity
date. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option,
prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and, if
applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement
process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our
common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period
in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is
measured quarter by quarter. In the second quarter of 2009, the
price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each
series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the
specified period and, as a result, the holders do not have the
option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the
third quarter of 2009 under this provision. The notes are also
convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified
five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain
levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common
stock. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible
senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal
amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion
value in excess of such principal amount. We will pay contingent
interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been
outstanding at least ten years, under certain conditions. We may
redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding
for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount
of the notes, payable in cash. The optional repurchase dates, the
common stock price conversion threshold amounts and the ending date
of the first six-month period contingent interest may be payable

follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Repurchase

Discount at December 31, 2008 is adjusted for the
retrospective application of FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for
Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon
Conversion. Discount at June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008 included $936 million and $1.009 billion,
respectively, associated with the equity component of our
contingent convertible senior notes. (d)
See Note 2 for discussion related to these
instruments. No scheduled principal
payments are required under our senior notes until 2013 when $864
million is due. Our outstanding senior notes
are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake that rank equally in
right of payment with all of our existing and future senior
indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our
future subordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the senior notes,
other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at
specified make-whole or redemption prices. Senior notes issued
before July 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants
that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries’
ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our
capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or
subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted
payments; incur liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions;
create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to
us from our restricted subsidiaries; engage in transactions with
affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets.
Senior notes issued after June 2005 are governed by indentures
containing covenants that limit our ability and our
subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured indebtedness;
enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or
transfer assets. Chesapeake Energy Corporation
is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no
significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. As of
September 30, 2008, our obligations under our outstanding
senior notes and contingent convertible notes were fully and
unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of our
wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries, other than minor
subsidiaries, on a senior unsecured basis. In October 2008, we
restructured our non-Appalachian midstream operations. As a result,
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, our wholly-owned midstream
subsidiaries having significant assets and operations do not
guarantee our outstanding senior notes. On January 1, 2009, we
adopted and applied retrospectively FASB Staff Position No. APB
14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). We have three debt issuances
affected by this change: our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior
Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due
2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038.
FSP APB 14-1 requires us to account for the liability and equity
components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to
reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar
nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance (6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%,
respectively). Additionally, debt issuance costs are required to be
allocated in proportion to the liability and equity components and
accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs,
respectively. The allocation to the equity component of the
convertible notes was $845 million (net of tax) at
December 31, 2008. The accretion of the resulting discount on
the debt is recognized as a part of interest expense, thereby
increasing the amount of interest expense required to be recognized
with respect to such instruments. Given the increase in our overall
effective interest rate after adoption of FSP APB 14-1, we also
capitalized additional interest which largely offset the increase
in interest expense. The following table
summarizes the effect of the change in accounting principle related

3,574 We have a $3.5 billion
syndicated revolving bank credit facility which matures in November
2012. As of June 30, 2009, we had $2.834 billion in
outstanding borrowings under this facility and utilized
approximately $10 million of the facility for various letters of
credit. Borrowings under the facility
are secured by certain producing natural gas and oil properties and
bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the
reference rate of Union Bank, N.A. or the federal funds effective
rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies
from 0.00% to 0.75% per annum according to our senior
unsecured long-term debt ratings, or (ii) the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to
2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term
debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are
determined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is
subject to a commitment fee of 0.50%. Interest is payable quarterly
or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent
intervals. The credit facility agreement
contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit
our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or
loans and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires us
to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio (as
defined) not to exceed 0.70 to 1 and an indebtedness to EBITDA
ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.75 to 1. As defined by the
credit facility agreement, our indebtedness to total capitalization
ratio was 0.43 to 1 and our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 3.47
to 1 at June 30, 2009. If we should fail to perform our
obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit
commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under
the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such
acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million ($50
million in the case of our senior notes issued after 2004), would
constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures,
which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant
portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility
agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other
indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an
outstanding principal amount in excess of $75 million. Two of our subsidiaries,
Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C. and Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C.,
are the borrowers under our revolving bank credit facility. The
facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and
several basis, by Chesapeake and all of our other wholly-owned
restricted subsidiaries. We also have a $460 million
syndicated revolving bank credit facility for our midstream
operations, organized under an unrestricted subsidiary, Chesapeake
Midstream Partners, L.P. (CMP) and its operating subsidiary,
Chesapeake Midstream Operating, L.L.C. (CMO). CMO is the borrower
under the facility, which matures in October 2013 and may be
expanded up to $750 million at CMO’s option, subject to
additional bank participation. CMO is utilizing the facility to
fund capital expenditures associated with building additional
natural gas gathering and other systems associated with our
drilling program and for general corporate purposes related to our
midstream operations. As of June 30, 2009, we had $297 million
in outstanding borrowings under the midstream credit
facility. Borrowings under the
midstream credit facility are secured by all of the assets of the
midstream companies organized under CMP and bear interest at our
option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the federal funds effective
rate plus 0.50%, and the one-month LIBOR plus 1.50%, all of which
would be subject to a margin that varies from 0.75% to
1.50% per annum according to the most recent indebtedness to
EBITDA ratio (as defined) or (ii) the LIBOR plus a margin that
varies from 1.75% to 2.50% per annum according to the most
recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined). The unused
portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee that varies
from 0.30% to 0.45% per annum according the most recent
indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined). Interest is payable
quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be paid at more frequent
intervals. The midstream credit facility
agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions
which limit the ability of CMP and its subsidiaries to incur
additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create
liens. The credit facility agreement requires maintenance of an
indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.50 to 1,
and an EBITDA (as defined) to interest expense coverage ratio of
not less than 2.50 to 1. As defined by the credit facility
agreement, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 1.35 to 1 and our
EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio was 12.84 to 1 at
June 30, 2009. If CMP or its subsidiaries should fail to
perform their obligations under these and other covenants, the
revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding
borrowings under the midstream facility could be declared
immediately due and payable. The midstream credit facility
agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other
indebtedness CMP and its subsidiaries may have with an outstanding
principal amount in excess of $15 million. Our revolving bank credit
facility and the midstream credit facility do not contain material
adverse change or adequate assurance covenants. Although the
applicable interest rates in our revolving bank credit facility
fluctuate slightly based on our long-term senior unsecured credit
ratings, neither of our credit facilities contains provisions which
would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities
or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a
downgrade of our credit ratings. "

852,767 Issuance of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 On February 13, 2009, we issued $420 million of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (“2016 Notes”). The 2016 Notes, which carry a coupon rate of 9.75%, were sold at a discount (92.816% of par), which equates to an effective yield to maturity of approximately 11.25%. The net proceeds of $381.4 million were used to repay most of our then-outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility, which increased from the December 31, 2008 balance, primarily associated with the funding of the Hastings Field acquisition (see Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures”). In conjunction with this debt offering we amended our bank credit facility in early February 2009, which, among other things, allowed us to issue these senior subordinated notes. In June 2009, we issued an additional $6.35 million of the 2016 Notes to our founder, Gareth Roberts, as part of a Founder’s Retirement Agreement. In connection with this issuance, we recorded compensation expense of $6.35 million in General and administrative expense in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. The 2016 Notes mature on March 1, 2016, and interest on the 2016 Notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2009. We may redeem the 2016 Notes in whole or in part at our option beginning March 1, 2013, at the following redemption prices: 104.875% after March 1, 2013, 102.4375% after March 1, 2014, and 100%, after March 1, 2015. In addition, we may at our option, redeem up to an aggregate of 35% of the 2016 Notes before March 1, 2012 at a price of 109.75%. The indenture contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends on our common stock, make investments, create liens on our assets, engage in transactions with our affiliates, transfer or sell assets, consolidate or merge, or sell substantially all of our assets. The 2016 Notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. All of our significant subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee this debt. Senior Bank Loan To clarify that Denbury entities are allowed to guarantee obligations of other Denbury entities, in May 2009 we amended our Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the instrument governing our Senior Bank Loan, to explicitly permit these guarantees and waive any possible previous technical violations of this provision. In June 2009 we again amended our Senior Bank Loan agreement in connection with the sale of our Barnett Shale natural gas properties and (i) reduced our borrowing base from $1.0 billion to $900 million and (ii) allowed for an additional percentage of our forecasted production to be hedged through June 30, 2009. The amendment did not impact the banks’ commitment amount, which remains at $750 million. "

4 MORTGAGES, NOTES AND LOANS PAYABLE Mortgages, notes and loans
payable are summarized as follows: June 30, December 31, 2009 2008 (In thousands) Fixed-rate debt: Collateralized mortgages, notes and loans payable $ 15,678,288 $ 15,538,825 Corporate and other unsecured term loans 3,716,968 3,701,615 Total fixed-rate debt 19,395,256 19,240,440 Variable-rate debt: Collateralized mortgages, notes and loans payable 2,695,876 2,732,437 Corporate and other unsecured term loans 2,783,700 2,783,700 Total variable-rate debt 5,479,576 5,516,137 Total mortgages, notes and loans payable $ 24,874,832 $ 24,756,577 As previously discussed,
on April 16 and 22, 2009, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief
under Chapter 11, which triggered defaults on substantially all debt obligations
of the Debtors. However, under section 362 of Chapter 11, the filing of a
bankruptcy petition automatically stays most actions against the debtors
estate. Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, these pre-petition liabilities
are subject to settlement under a plan of reorganization, and therefore are
presented as Liabilities subject to compromise on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Of the total amount of debt presented above, $3.04 billion is not
subject to compromise, consisting primarily of the collateralized mortgages of
Non-Debtors and the DIP Facility as defined and described below. The weighted-average
interest rate, including the effects of interest rate swaps, excluding the
effects of deferred finance costs and using the contract rate prior to any
defaults on such loans, on our mortgages, notes and loans payable was 5.33% at
June 30, 2009 and 5.36% at December 31, 2008. Our mortgages, notes and
loans payable have various maturities through 2095. The weighted-average
remaining term of our mortgages, notes and loans payable, excluding the affect
of any acceleration triggered by our Chapter 11 Cases but precluded by the
protection afforded the Debtors, was 2.56 years as of June 30, 2009. The
weighted average interest rate, using the contract rate prior to any defaults on
such loans, on the remaining corporate unsecured fixed and variable rate debt
and the revolving credit facility was 4.32% at June 30, 2009 and 4.29% at
December 31, 2008. As of June 30, 2009,
$24.53 billion of land, buildings and equipment and developments in progress
(before accumulated depreciation) have been pledged as collateral for our
mortgages, notes and loans payable. Although substantially all of the $24.87
billion of fixed and variable rate mortgage notes and loans payable are
non-recourse to us, $2.64 billion of such mortgages, notes and loans payable are
recourse to us due to guarantees or other security provisions for the benefit of
the note holder. In addition, although certain mortgage loans contain other
credit enhancement provisions (primarily master leases for all or a portion of
the property), as of June 30, 2009 we did not expect to be required to
perform with respect to such provisions. Certain mortgage notes payable may be
prepaid but are generally subject to a prepayment penalty equal to a
yield-maintenance premium, defeasance or a percentage of the loan
balance. Debtor-in-Possession Facility
On May 14, 2009, the
Bankruptcy Court issued an order authorizing certain Debtors to enter into a
Senior Secured Debtor in Possession Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement
among the Company, as co-borrower, GGP Limited Partnership, as co-borrower,
certain of their subsidiaries, as guarantors, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as agent
(the DIP Agent), and the lenders party thereto (the DIP
Facility). The DIP Facility, which
closed on May 15, 2009, provides for an aggregate commitment of
$400 million (the DIP Term Loan), which was used to refinance the $215
million remaining balance on the Short-term Secured Loan and the remainder of
which will provide additional liquidity to the Debtors during the pendency of
the Chapter 11 Cases, including to fund our portion of venture mortgage
loans (Note 3). The DIP Facility provides that principal outstanding on
the DIP Term Loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a
minimum LIBOR floor of 1.5%) plus 12%, and matures at the earlier of
May 16, 2011 or the effective date of a plan of reorganization with respect
of the Debtors. Subject to certain
conditions being present, the Company will have the right to elect to repay all
or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the DIP Term Loan, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all exit fees at maturity, by issuing
(i) common stock of the Company to the lenders (the Equity Conversion) or
(ii) debt to the lenders, which would be issued for a three-year term,
prepayable at any time without penalty or premium, and otherwise on terms
substantially similar to those of the DIP Term Loan. Any Equity Conversion will
be limited to the lenders receipt of Company common stock equaling no more than
(i) 8.0% of the Company common stock distributed in connection with the
Debtors plan of reorganization, as confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court (the Plan
of Reorganization) on a fully-diluted basis, or (ii) 9.9% of the Company
common stock actually distributed in connection with the Plan of Reorganization
on its effective date, without giving effect to common stock held back for the
payment of contingencies. The DIP Credit Agreement contains customary
non-financial covenants, representations and warranties, and events of default.
Although the DIP Agreement contains no financial covenants, it does include
obligations to periodically provide certain operating information concerning the
Debtors directly to the DIP Agent.

870 Senior Notes In connection with the merger of Grant Prideco, the Company completed an exchange offer relative to the $175 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2015 previously issued by Grant Prideco. On April 21, 2008, $151 million of Grant Prideco Senior Notes were exchanged for National Oilwell Varco Senior Notes. The National Oilwell Varco Senior Notes have the same interest rate, interest payment dates, redemption terms and maturity as the Grant Prideco Senior Notes. In November 2008, the Company repurchased $23 million of the unexchanged Grant Prideco Senior Notes. Revolving Credit Facilities On April 21, 2008, the Company replaced its existing $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate of $3 billion of unsecured credit facilities and borrowed $2 billion to finance the cash portion of the Grant Prideco acquisition. These facilities consisted of a $2 billion, five-year revolving credit facility and a $1 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility. At June 30, 2009, there were no borrowings against these facilities, and there were $636 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under these facilities, resulting in $1,364 million of funds available under this revolving credit facility. Interest under this multicurrency facility is based upon LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR plus 0.26% subject to a ratings-based grid, or the prime rate. In early February 2009, we terminated early the $1 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility, which matured April 20, 2009. The Company also had $2,414 million of additional outstanding letters of credit at June 30, 2009, primarily in Norway, that are essentially under various bilateral committed letter of credit facilities. Other letters of credit are issued as bid bonds and performance bonds. The Senior Notes contain reporting covenants and the credit facility contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt to capitalization. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2009. Other Other debt includes approximately $5 million in promissory notes due to former owners of businesses acquired. "

Callable subject to certain conditions as described in the
prospectus filed with the SEC on November 4, 2002. On
July 29, 2009, the Company announced the commencement of an
offer to exchange shares of its common stock for any and all of the
5,498,544 outstanding units of its Bifurcated Option Note Unit
SecuritiESSM
(the “BONUSES
units”). The BONUSES units were issued on November 4,
2002 by the Company and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol “NYB.PrU.” Each unit consists of a
trust preferred security issued by New York Community Capital Trust
V and a warrant to purchase shares of the Company’s common
stock. All holders of BONUSES units
are eligible to participate in the exchange offer, the terms and
conditions of which are set forth in an Offer to Exchange and a
related Letter of Transmittal that were sent to current holders of
the BONUSES units and filed on July 29, 2009 with the SEC on a
Schedule TO. Any BONUSES unit that is not exchanged will remain
outstanding. Any BONUSES unit that is validly tendered and accepted
for exchange in the Exchange Offer will be retired and
cancelled. The Exchange Ratio to be used
to determine the number of shares of the Company’s common
stock to be exchanged for each BONUSES unit will be calculated at
4:30 p.m., New York City time, on the second trading day
immediately preceding the expiration date for the Exchange Offer,
as such date may be extended (the “Pricing Date”). As
more fully described in the Offer to Exchange and Letter of
Transmittal, the minimum Exchange Ratio will be 2.4953 common
shares for each BONUSES unit that is validly tendered and accepted,
and the maximum Exchange Ratio will be 4.4953 common shares. The
Exchange Ratio will be rounded to the nearest fourth decimal
place. The Exchange Offer is
expected to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on
August 25, 2009, unless extended by the Company, and the
settlement date is expected to be three days following the
expiration date. "

into a 364-Day Secured Liquidity Credit Facility Agreement with
National City Bank (NCB). Under this agreement, we may borrow up to
$125 million, which may be increased to $150 million at our request
but subject to NCB’s discretion. In conjunction with this
agreement, we deposited $125 million into an FDIC-insured deposit
account at NCB in January 2009 to provide us with additional cash
availability in the event of a disruption to our cash management
operations. Our access to these funds is unrestricted. However, if
we withdraw funds from this account for any reason other than in
connection with such a disruption in our cash management
operations, the availability of borrowings under the NCB credit
facility will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis until such
time as we replenish the funds to the deposit account. The credit
facility will expire on December 31, 2009, unless earlier
terminated according to its terms. We had no borrowings under this
arrangement in 2008 or through the first six months of
2009. "

1,2009-08-10,1050915,XBRL," 7. DEBT: Credit Facility Quanta has a credit facility with various lenders that provides for a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the conditions specified in the credit facility, borrowings under the credit facility are to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire unused portion of the credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of June 30, 2009, Quanta had approximately $158.0 million of letters of credit issued under the credit facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining $317.0 million was available for revolving loans or issuing new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility), or (b) the base rate (as described below) plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the credit facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.875% to 1.75%, based on the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the credit facility. The base rate equals the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1/2 of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate. The credit facility contains certain covenants, including covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio, Quanta’s maximum funded debt and maximum senior debt are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the credit facility) held by Quanta in excess of $25.0 million. As of June 30, 2009, Quanta was in compliance with all of its covenants. The credit facility limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material assets. The credit facility also limits the payment of dividends and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock. The credit facility provides for customary events of default and carries cross-default provisions with all of Quanta’s existing subordinated notes, its continuing indemnity and security agreement with its sureties and all of its other debt instruments exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries and substantially all of its assets. Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit facility. Quanta’s obligations under the credit facility constitute designated senior indebtedness under its 3.75% convertible subordinated notes. 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes At June 30, 2009, Quanta had outstanding $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes). The resale of the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion thereof was registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The 3.75% Notes mature on April 30, 2026 and bear interest at the annual rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30, until maturity. The $122.3 million and $124.4 million of convertible subordinated notes on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2009 is presented net of a debt discount of $21.5 million and $19.4 million, which is amortized as interest expense over the remaining amortization period. This debt discount was recorded in accordance with the January 1, 2009 adoption of FSP APB 14-1 as discussed in Notes 1 and 3. The effective interest rate used to calculate total interest expense for the 3.75% Notes under FSP APB 14-1 was 7.85%. At June 30, 2009, the remaining amortization period of the debt discount is approximately 3.8 years. The 3.75% Notes are convertible into Quanta’s common stock, based on an initial conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.75% Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.41 per share), subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The 3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder (i) during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of Quanta’s common stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, (ii) upon Quanta calling the 3.75% Notes for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence of specified distributions to holders of Quanta’s common stock or specified corporate transactions or (iv) at any time on or after March 1, 2026 until the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes. The 3.75% Notes are not presently convertible, although they have been convertible in certain prior quarters as a result of the satisfaction of the market price condition described in clause (i) above. If the 3.75% Notes become convertible under any of these circumstances, Quanta has the option to deliver cash, shares of Quanta’s common stock or a combination thereof, with the amount of cash determined in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes were issued. Conversions that may occur in the future could result in the recording of losses on extinguishment of debt if the conversions are settled in cash for an amount in excess of the principal amount. The holders of the 3.75% Notes who convert their notes in connection with certain change in control transactions, as defined in the indenture, may be entitled to a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. In the event of a change in control, in lieu of paying holders a make whole premium, if applicable, Quanta may elect, in some circumstances, to adjust the conversion rate and related conversion obligations so that the 3.75% Notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company. Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013, Quanta may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Quanta’s common stock is equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price then in effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of mailing of the notice of redemption. In addition, Quanta may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after April 30, 2010 at certain redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Beginning with the six-month interest period commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month interest period thereafter, Quanta will be required to pay contingent interest on any outstanding 3.75% Notes during the applicable interest period if the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes reaches a specified threshold. The contingent interest payable within any applicable interest period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes during a five trading day reference period. The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require Quanta to repurchase all or a part of the notes in cash on each of April 30, 2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2021, and in the event of a change in control of Quanta, as defined in the indenture, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 3.75% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 3.75% Notes carry cross-default provisions with Quanta’s other debt instruments exceeding $20.0 million in borrowings, which includes Quanta’s existing credit facility. 4.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes During 2008, the holders of $269.8 million aggregate principal amount of Quanta’s 4.5% convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) elected to convert their notes, resulting in the issuance of 24,229,781 shares of Quanta’s common stock, substantially all of which followed a notice of redemption by Quanta that it would redeem on October 8, 2008 all of the 4.5% Notes outstanding pursuant to the indenture governing the notes. Quanta also repurchased $106,000 aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes on October 1, 2008 pursuant to the holders’ election and redeemed for cash $49,000 aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on October 8, 2008. As a result of all of these transactions, none of the 4.5% Notes remained outstanding as of October 8, 2008. The 4.5% Notes were originally issued in October 2003 for an aggregate principal amount of $270.0 million and required semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 until maturity. "

1,126,084 Credit facility borrowings: In December 2006, the Company entered into a 5-year, $1.0 billion committed credit facility (Credit Facility) that it may draw on for general corporate purposes and to support its commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the United States Prime Rate (Prime Rate) or United States Dollar London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.235%, at the election of the Company. In the event that over half of the Credit Facility is drawn upon, an additional five basis points is added to the elected Prime Rate or LIBOR rate. The interest rates are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the Company’s credit ratings. In October 2008, the Company borrowed $500.0 million under the Credit Facility to partially fund the retirement of the Company’s 1.22% Convertible Debentures in December 2008. In November 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract to convert $400.0 million of variable-rate borrowings under the Credit Facility into fixed-rate borrowings. The Company designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No. 133). This contract terminated in February 2009 and payments made or received under this interest rate swap contract were recorded to interest expense. Inclusive of the interest rate swap, borrowings under the Credit Facility incurred interest at a weighted average interest rate of 0.7% and 1.1% during the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively. Commercial paper borrowings: The Company’s commercial paper program provides for the issuance of short-term, unsecured commercial paper with maturities up to 270 days. The Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of July 4, 2009. Any future commercial paper borrowings would bear interest at the applicable then-current market rates. The Company classifies all of its commercial paper borrowings as long-term debt, as the Company has the ability to repay any short-term maturity with available cash from its existing long-term, committed Credit Facility. Term loan due 2011: In December 2008, the Company entered into a 3-year, unsecured term loan (2011 Term Loan). The Company initially borrowed $360.0 million in December 2008 and borrowed an additional $180.0 million in January 2009, resulting in total original borrowings of $540.0 million under the 2011 Term Loan.

The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement dated June 25, 2009 between the Company and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named therein. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that may limit the Company’s ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon its principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to, any other party. On June 30, 2009, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions where the Company swapped the notional amount of its $375 million of fixed rate debt at 5.0% into floating interest rate debt through July 1, 2014. Under the terms of the swaps, the Company will (i) receive on the $375 million notional amount a 5.0% annual interest payment that is paid in two installments on the 1st of every January and July, commencing January 1, 2010 through and ending on the maturity date; and (ii) pay on the $375 million notional amount an annual three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.64% as of August 1, 2009) interest payment, payable in four installments on the 1st of every January, April, July and October, commencing on October 1, 2009 and ending on the maturity date. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. The Company designated these swaps as fair value hedges and is accounting for them in accordance with SFAS 133. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swaps in other assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount. "

5,2009-08-20,46640,XBRL," (11) Debt and Financing Arrangements On June 12, 2009, the Company entered into a three-year $175 million accounts receivable securitization program. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company sells, on a revolving basis, its receivables to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote-subsidiary. This subsidiary then sells all of the rights, title and interest in a pool of these receivables to an unaffiliated entity. After the sale, the Company, as servicer of the assets, collects the receivables on behalf of the unaffiliated entity. The amount of receivables sold through this program as of July 29, 2009 was $131.8 million. The proceeds from this securitization program are recognized on the statements of cash flows as a component of operating activities. On July 29, 2009, H. J. Heinz Finance Company (“HFC”), a subsidiary of Heinz, issued $250 million of 7.125% notes due 2039 through a private placement. The notes are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Company. The proceeds from the notes were used for payment of the cash component of the exchange transaction discussed below as well as various expenses relating to the exchange, and for general corporate purposes. On August 6, 2009, subsequent to the end of the first quarter, HFC exchanged $681 million of 7.125% notes due 2039 (of the same series as the notes issued in the private placement), and $217.5 million of cash, for $681 million of their outstanding 15.590% dealer remarketable securities due December 1, 2020. In addition, HFC terminated a portion of the remarketing option by paying the remarketing agent a cash payment of $89.0 million. The exchange transaction will be accounted for as a modification of debt. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of July 29, 2009. "

 Debt and Credit Agreements On March 3, 2009, the Company terminated and
paid off all outstanding balances from the Corporate Express U.S. and European
securitization programs that were assumed upon the acquisition of Corporate
Express. On March 27, 2009, the Company issued $500.0
million aggregate principal amount of notes (the March 2009 Notes) due
April 1, 2011, with a fixed interest rate of 7.75% payable semi-annually on
April 1 and October 1 of each year commencing on October 1,
2009. The sale of the March 2009 Notes was made pursuant to the terms
of an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement), dated
March 27, 2009, with Barclays Capital Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC
and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters
named in the Underwriting Agreement. The Company received net proceeds,
after the underwriting discount and estimated fees and expenses, of $497.5
million. The Companys obligations under the March 2009 Notes are
unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured unsubordinated basis by Staples the
Office Superstore, LLC, Staples the Office Superstore East, Inc., Staples
Contract & Commercial, Inc. and Staples the Office Superstore,
Limited Partnership (collectively, the Guarantor Subsidiaries). On March 27, 2009, the Company reduced its
total commitment under the Credit Agreement, dated April 1, 2008, among the
Company, Barclays Bank PLC and the other lenders named therein, as amended (the
2008 Agreement) from $1.26 billion to $761.0 million, pursuant to the
mandatory commitment reduction provisions triggered by the receipt of proceeds
from the offering of the March 2009 Notes. Originally, the total
commitment under the 2008 Agreement was $3.0 billion. On May 19, 2009, the Company entered into a
$300.0 million accounts receivable securitization program (the Securitization
Program) with several of its wholly owned subsidiaries and certain financial
institutions. Under the terms of the Securitization Program, the
subsidiaries sell substantially all the customer receivables of the Companys
North American Delivery business to a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special
purpose entity, Staples Receivables LLC. The Company retains servicing
responsibility. The special purpose entity then transfers an interest in
the receivables to the financial institutions. Borrowings outstanding
under the Securitization Program are included as a component of current
liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, while the accounts
receivable securing these obligations are included as a component of net
receivables in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Total borrowings
outstanding under the Securitization Program at August 1, 2009 were $300.0
million. On May 26, 2009, as a result of entering into
the Securitization Program, the Company voluntarily terminated the entire
remaining commitment under the 2008 Agreement, thereby terminating the 2008
Agreement earlier than its July 9, 2009 expiration date. As a result
of the termination of the 2008 Agreement, availability under the Companys
existing commercial paper program was reduced from approximately $1.5 billion to
$750.0 million. The commercial paper program continues to be backstopped
by Staples existing $750.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of
America N.A. and other lenders named therein, which matures in October 2011
(the Revolving Credit Facility). As of August 1, 2009, $107.1
million of Notes were outstanding under the Companys commercial paper
program. The Notes have a weighted average remaining maturity of 29 days
with a weighted average interest rate of 0.7%. In connection with the March 2009 Notes, the
issuance of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due
January 15, 2014 (the January 2009 Notes), the 2008 Agreement and
the Securitization Program, the Company incurred financing fees of $33.1
million, which are being amortized over the terms of the related debt
instruments. Amortization of the financing fees is classified as interest
expense. Deferred financing fees amortized to interest expense were $2.1
million and $4.1 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended
August 1, 2009, respectively. Unamortized financing fees of $3.3
million were included in prepaid and other current assets and unamortized fees
of $12.2 million were included in other assets. At August 1, 2009, the fair value of the
January 2009 Notes was approximately $1.75 billion and the fair value of
the March 2009 Notes was approximately $532 million. There were no instances of default during the
first half of 2009 under any of the Companys debt
agreements.

TJX pays six basis points on an annual basis in commitment fees related to both of these facilities. These agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as back up to TJX’s commercial paper program. TJX had no borrowings outstanding at August 1, 2009 or July 26, 2008. The availability under revolving credit facilities was $1 billion at August 1, 2009 and July 26, 2008. On April 7, 2009, TJX issued $375 million of 6.95% ten-year notes and shortly thereafter called for the redemption of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes, originally due in 2021. Upon our call for redemption, holders had the right to convert the notes into TJX common stock at a conversion rate of 32.667 shares per note. Virtually all of the subordinated notes were converted into 15.1 million shares of TJX common stock, most during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. TJX has used, and expects to use, the remainder of the proceeds from the 6.95% notes offering to repurchase additional common stock under its stock repurchase program in fiscal 2010. On July 23, 2009, TJX issued $400 million of 4.20% six-year notes. TJX used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance its C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009, prior to its scheduled maturity, and expects to use the remainder, together with funds from operations to pay its $200 million 7.45% notes due December 15, 2009 at maturity.

4,2009-09-09,64670,XBRL,"Note 9 – Financing Arrangements Senior Convertible Notes In April 2006, the Company issued $2.200 billion of 1.500 percent Senior Convertible Notes due 2011 and $2.200 billion of 1.625 percent Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 (collectively, the Senior Convertible Notes). The Senior Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest in cash semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The Senior Convertible Notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Concurrent with the issuance of the Senior Convertible Notes, the Company purchased call options on its common stock in pri
vate transactions. The call options allow the Company to receive shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash from counterparties equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that it would pay to the holders of the Senior Convertible Notes upon conversion.In separate transactions, the Company sold warrants to issue shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $76.56 per share in private transactions. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for 41 million shares of the Company’s common stock may be settled over a specified period beginning in July 2011 and warrants for 41 million shares of the Company’s common stock may be settled over a specified period beginning in July 2013.In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07-5, “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock” (EITF No. 07-5)
. EITF No. 07-5 provides guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entity's own stock and classified in shareholders’ equity or whether it should be bifurcated and classified as a separate asset or liability and marked-to-market through earnings. The Company adopted EITF No. 07-5 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. In applying EITF No. 07-5, the Company concluded that the purchased call options and sold warrants were indexed to its own stock and should continue to be classified in shareholders’ equity; thus consistent with prior periods, EITF Issue No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock” (EITF No. 00-19) would still apply. Under EITF No. 00-19, the notes are accounted for as a combined instrument because the conversion spread meets the requirements of EITF No. 00-19, including the pr
ovisions contained in paragraphs 12–32 of EITF No. 00-19. Accordingly, the “conversion spread” is not separated as a derivative.EITF No. 00-19 provides that contracts are initially classified as equity if (1) the contract requires physical settlement or net-share settlement, or (2) the contract gives the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The settlement terms of the Company’s purchased call options and sold warrant contracts provide for net cash settlement for the particular contract or net share settlement, depending on the method of settlement, as discussed above, which is at the option of the Company. Based on the guidance from EITF No. 00-19 and SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133), the purchased call option contracts were recorded as a reduction of eq
uity and the warrants were recorded as an addition to equity as of the trade date. SFAS No. 133 states that a reporting entity shall not consider contracts to be derivative instruments if the contract issued or held by the reporting entity is both indexed to its own stock and classified in shareholders’ equity in its statement of financial position. The Company concluded the purchased call option contracts and the warrant contracts should be accounted for in shareholders’ equity.Effective April 25, 2009, the Company accounts for the Senior Convertible Notes in accordance with FSP APB No. 14-1. FSP APB No. 14-1 requires the proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Convertible Notes to be allocated between a liability component (issued at a discount) and an equity component. The resulting debt discount is amortized over the period the Senior Convertible Notes are expected to be outstanding as additional non-cash interest expense. This change in accounting f
or the Senior Convertible Notes has been applied to the Company’s prior period financial statements on a retrospective basis, as required by FSP APB No. 14-1. For additional information on the impact of this change to the Company’s financial statements, refer to Note 3.The following table provides equity and debt information for the Senior Convertible Notes under FSP APB No. 14-1.

The first tranche consisted of $550 million of 4.500 percent Senior Notes due 2014, the second tranche consisted of $400 million of 5.600 percent Senior Notes due 2019 and the third tranche consisted of $300 million of 6.500 percent Senior Notes due 2039. The first tranche was issued at par, the second tranche was issued at a discount which resulted in an effective interest rate of 5.609 percent and the third tranche was issued at a discount which resulted in an effective interest rate of 6.519 percent. Interest on each series of New Senior Notes is payable semi-annually, on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing September 15, 2009. The New Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indentures under which the New Senior Notes were issued contain customary covenants. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the New Senior Notes for repayment of a portion of its commercial paper and for general corporate uses.In September 2005, the Company issued two tranches of Senior Notes with the aggregate face value of $1.000 billion. The first tranche consisted of $400 million of 4.375 percent Senior Notes due 2010 and the second tranche consisted of $600 million of 4.750 percent Senior Notes due 2015. Each tranche was issued at a discount which resulted in an effective interest rate of 4.433 percent and 4.760 percent for the five and ten year Senior Notes, respectively. Interest on each series of Senior Notes is payable semi-annually, on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Senior Notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the Company and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indentures under which Senior Notes were issued contain customary covenants. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes for repayment of a portion of its commercial paper. In June 2009, the Company entered into two five year interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $150 million each. These interest rate swap agreements were designated as fair value hedges of the changes in fair value of a portion of the Company’s fixed-rate $550 million Senior Notes due 2014. On the first interest rate swap agreement, the Company pays variable interest equal to the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 134 basis points and it receiv
es a fixed interest rate of 4.50 percent. For the second interest rate swap agreement, the Company pays variable interest equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 137.25 basis points and it receives a fixed interest rate of 4.50 percent. The outstanding market value of these swap agreements was a $6 million unrealized gain at July 31, 2009 which is recorded in long-term debt with the offset recorded in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Contingent Convertible Debentures As of July 31, 2009 and April 24, 2009, the Company has $15 million remaining in aggregate principal amount of 1.250 percent Contingent Convertible Debentures, Series B due 2021 (the Debentures) outstanding. Interest is payable semi-annually. Each Debenture is convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $61.81 per share; however, the Debentures are not convertible before their final maturity unless the closing price of our common stock reaches 110 percent of the conversion price for 20 trading days during a consecutive 30 trading day period. Upon conversion of the Debentures, the Company will pay holders cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the Debentures or their conversion value, and shares of the Company’s common stock to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the Debentures. The Company may be required to repurchase the remaining debentures at the option of the holders in September 2011 or 2016. For put options exercised by the holders of the Debentures, the purchase price is equal to the principal amount of the applicable debenture plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the repurchase date. If the put option is exercised, the Company will pay holders the repurchase price solely in cash. The Company can redeem the debentures for cash at any time. Commercial Paper The Company maintains a commercial paper pr
ogram that allows the Company to have a maximum of $2.250 billion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 364 days from the date of issuance. As of July 31, 2009 and April 24, 2009, outstanding commercial paper totaled $506 million and $385 million, respectively. During the three months ended July 31, 2009, the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately 46 days, and the weighted average interest rate was 0.25 percent. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing lines of credit.Bank Borrowings Bank borrowings consist primarily of borrowings from non-U.S. banks at interest rates considered favorable by management and where natural hedges can be gained for foreign exchange purposes. Lines of Credit The Company has existing unsecured lines of credit of approximatel
y $2.839 billion with various banks at July 31, 2009. The existing lines of credit include a five-year $1.750 billion syndicated credit facility dated December 20, 2006 that will expire on December 20, 2011 (Credit Facility). The Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility provides the Company with the ability to increase its capacity by an additional $500 million at any time during the life of the five-year term of the agreement.As of July 31, 2009 and April 24, 2009, the Company has unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity of approximately $2.681 billion and $2.799 billion, respectively. Interest rates on these borrowings are determined by a pricing matrix, based on the Company’s long-term debt ratings, assigned by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors Service. Facility fees are payable on the credit facilities and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates."

3,2009-09-09,1326380,XBRL," 6. Debt In October 2005, the Company entered into a five-year, $400,000 Credit Agreement (the “Revolver”), including a $50,000 letter of credit sub-limit, secured by the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolver places certain restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. In April 2007, the Company amended the Revolver to extend the maturity date from October 11, 2010 to April 25, 2012, reduce the LIBO interest rate margin, reduce and fix the rate of the unused commitment fee and modify or delete certain other covenants. The extension of the Revolver to 2012 reduces our exposure to the current tightening in the credit markets. The availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base which allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (x) approximately 70% of eligible inventory and (y) 90% of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus 85% of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow by their face value. The Company’s ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options and repurchase shares is generally prohibited, except that if availability under the Revolver is, or will be after any such payment, equal to or greater than 25% of the borrowing base, the Company may repurchase its capital stock and pay cash dividends. In addition, in the event that credit extensions under the Revolver at any time exceed 80% of the lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, the Company will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.5:1.0. The per annum interest rate on the Revolver is variable and, at the Company’s option, is calculated by applying a margin of (1) 0.0% to 0.25% above the higher of the prime rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (2) 1.00% to 1.50% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. As of August 1, 2009, the applicable margin was 0.0% for prime rate loans and 1.00% for LIBO rate loans. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. During the 13 weeks ended August 1, 2009, the Company borrowed and repaid $100,000 under the Revolver. As of August 1, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and letters of credit outstanding totaled $8,271. In September 2007, the Company’s Luxembourg subsidiary entered into a discretionary $20,000 Uncommitted Line of Credit (the “Line of Credit”) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit will be made available to the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short-term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of August 1, 2009, there were $287 of cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled $5,682. In September 2005, the Company, along with GameStop, Inc. as co-issuer (together with the Company, the “Issuers”), completed the offering of $650,000 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2012 (the “Notes”). The Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated September 28, 2005 (the “Indenture”), by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum, mature on October 1, 2012 and were priced at 98.688%, resulting in a discount at the time of issue of $8,528. The discount is being amortized using the effective interest method. As of August 1, 2009, the unamortized original issue discount was $3,428. The Issuers pay interest on the Notes semi-annually, in arrears, every April 1 and October 1, to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, and at maturity. The Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, limitations on (1) the incurrence of additional debt, (2) restricted payments, (3) liens, (4) sale and leaseback transactions and (5) asset sales. Events of default provided for in the Indenture include, among other things, failure to pay interest or principal on the Notes, other breaches of covenants in the Indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. As of August 1, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the Revolver and the Indenture. Under certain conditions, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions prior to maturity redeem up to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture at redemption prices at or in excess of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The circumstances which would limit the percentage of the Notes which may be redeemed or which would require the Company to pay a premium in excess of 100% of the principal amount are defined in the Indenture. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuers are required to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The Issuers may acquire Notes by means other than redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisitions do not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture. As of August 2, 2008 and August 1, 2009, the only long-term debt outstanding was related to the Notes. Between May 2006 and August 2007, the Company repurchased $70,000 of the Notes under previously announced buybacks authorized by its Board of Directors. All of the authorized amounts were repurchased and the Notes were delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. On February 7, 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of an additional $130,000 of the Notes. The timing and amount of the repurchases will be determined by the Company’s management based on their evaluation of market conditions and other factors. In addition, the repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of August 2, 2008, the Company had repurchased $30,000 of the Notes pursuant to this authorization. The associated loss on retirement of debt was $2,331, which consisted of the premium paid to retire the Notes and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. The Company did not repurchase any other Notes during fiscal 2008. In the 26 weeks ended August 1, 2009, the Company repurchased $50,765 of the Notes pursuant to this authorization. The associated loss on retirement of debt was $2,862, which consisted of the premium paid to retire the Notes and the write-off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. All Notes repurchased in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 were delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. "

540,967 We have a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Agreement”) which expires November 10, 2011. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the LIBOR Rate (defined as LIBOR plus 0.5% to 1.25%) or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%) at our option. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants, including covenants related to leverage and interest coverage. The Credit Agreement also restricts payments of dividends or other return of capital based on the consolidated leverage ratio. At July 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the Credit Agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital. At July 31, 2009, there were no outstanding direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $400.0 million credit limit, totaled $156.7 million. At July 31, 2009, there was $243.3 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Our acquisition that resulted in the creation of CCC was funded in part through a new $175.0 million term loan supplement to the Credit Agreement (“Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment calls for quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the initial term loan through October 31, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal equal to 62.5% of the initial term loan is due. As of July 31, 2009, $148.8 million is outstanding on the term loan. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the LIBOR Rate which has a weighted average interest rate of 1.008%. As part of the Second Amendment, we have the option to request an increase to the term loan outstanding in an amount not to exceed $75.0 million. No changes were made to existing financial covenants. In November 2006, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (collectively, the “Notes”) with interest on the Notes being paid in arrears semi-annually on May 15 and November 15. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future significant domestic subsidiaries. The Notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Notes were exchanged for similar notes registered under the Securities Act. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus 0.3% for the 2016 Notes and 0.375% for the 2036 Notes.

2,234 As of August 1, 2009 and August 2, 2008, we had $375 and $260 classified as current portion of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of August 1, 2009, this balance was primarily composed of $350 related to our series 2007-1 notes due in April 2010. As of August 2, 2008, the current portion of long-term debt consisted primarily of $250 related to our senior notes due in January 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we issued $400 senior unsecured notes at 6.75%, due June 2014. After deducting the original issue discount of $1 and other fees and expenses of $3, net proceeds from the offering were $396. We used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance to repay the $140 in outstanding issuances of commercial paper as of May 26, 2009, the date the senior notes were issued. We had no outstanding issuances under our $650 commercial paper program as of August 1, 2009. The issuance of commercial paper has the effect, while it is outstanding, of reducing borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility by an amount equal to the principal amount of commercial paper. As of August 1, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. On August 14, 2009, we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with a capacity of $650. This new credit facility replaced our existing $650 unsecured line of credit, which was scheduled to expire in November 2010. See further discussion of our $650 revolving credit facility in Note 8: Subsequent Event. Additionally, we had $300 in short-term capacity as of August 1, 2009 available under a Variable Funding Note facility (“2007-A VFN”). As of August 1, 2009 we had no outstanding issuances against this facility. The 2007-A VFN matures in November 2009 and can be cancelled if our debt ratings fall below Standard & Poor’s BB+ rating or Moody’s Ba1 rating. As of September 9, 2009, our rating by Standard & Poor’s was BBB+, four grades above the cancellation threshold, and by Moody’s was Baa2, three grades above the cancellation threshold. As of August 1, 2009, the fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, using quoted market prices of the same or similar issues, was $2,620. "

5. NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER
BORROWINGS In July 2009, we issued $4.5 billion of fixed
rate senior notes comprised of $1.5 billion of 3.750% notes due
July 2014 (2014 Notes), $1.75 billion of 5.000% notes due July 2019
(2019 Notes) and $1.25 billion of 6.125% notes due July 2039 (2039
Notes and, together with 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes, the Senior
Notes). We issued the Senior Notes for general corporate purposes
and future acquisitions, including our proposed acquisition of Sun
and acquisition related expenses. The effective interest yields of the 2014 Notes,
2019 Notes and 2039 Notes at August 31, 2009 were 3.750%, 5.056%
and 6.188%, respectively. On September 1, 2009 we entered into
interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of
modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the 2014
Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively
became variable (see Note 8 for additional information). The Senior Notes rank pari passu with any
commercial paper notes that we may issue pursuant to our commercial
paper program (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in our fiscal 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K
for further information on our commercial paper program) and all
existing and future senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All
existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle
Corporation will be effectively senior to the Senior
Notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related
covenants at August 31, 2009. Future principal payments of our
borrowings at August 31, 2009 were as follows: $1.0 billion in
fiscal 2010, $2.25 billion in fiscal 2011, none in fiscal 2012,
$1.25 billion in fiscal 2013, none in fiscal 2014, $1.5 billion in
fiscal 2015 and $8.75 billion thereafter. There have been no other significant changes in
our notes payable and other borrowing arrangements that were
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2009. "

Debt At
August 31, 2009, unsecured short-term borrowings consisted of
euro and U.S. dollar-denominated bank loans of $189 million and $10
million, respectively, with an aggregate weighted-average interest
rate of 0.7%. In February
2009, we borrowed $200 million under an unsecured term loan, which
bears interest at 4.5% and matures in February 2012. In March 2009,
we borrowed $301 million under an unsecured export credit facility,
the proceeds of which were used to pay for a portion of
AIDAluna’s purchase price. This facility bears
interest at EURIBOR plus 18 basis points (“bps”) and is
repayable in semi-annual installments through 2021. In May 2009, we
borrowed $486 million under an unsecured export credit facility,
the proceeds of which were used to pay for a portion of Costa
Pacifica’s purchase price. This facility bears
interest at EURIBOR plus 160 bps and is repayable in semi-annual
installments through 2019. In May 2009, we
entered into an unsecured two-year $150 million multi-currency
bilateral revolver, which has an undrawn commitment fee of 31 bps
and serves as back-up liquidity to our principal
revolver. In June 2009,
Costa Crociere S.p.A. (“Costa”), one of our Italian
subsidiaries, entered into an unsecured euro-denominated term loan
agreement with the European Investment Bank for $785 million. The
proceeds are to be used to fund a portion of their ships’
purchase prices. Costa borrowed $285 million in July 2009, which
bears interest at 4.5%, and anticipates drawing an additional $286
million in 2010 and the remaining $214 million in 2011. Each
borrowing will be repayable in semi-annual installments over 15
years from the date of funding. In June 2009,
we borrowed $83 million under an unsecured export credit facility,
the proceeds of which were used to pay for a portion of Seabourn
Odyssey’s purchase price. This facility bears interest at
LIBOR plus 160 bps and is repayable in semi-annual installments
through 2017. In June and
July 2009, we borrowed an aggregate of $200 million under two
unsecured term loans, each of which bear interest at LIBOR plus 250
bps and mature in May 2012. In July 2009,
we obtained an unsecured export credit facility, bearing interest
at LIBOR plus 150 bps, which provides us with the ability to borrow
up to a sterling-equivalent of $553 million for a portion of the
March 2010 P&O Cruises’ Azura final purchase
price. This borrowing will be repayable in semi-annual installments
over 10 years from the date of funding. In July and
August 2009, we restructured an existing unsecured euro-denominated
$581 million export credit facility for Carnival Dream.
Under the terms of the restructuring, the existing export credit
facility, which was to be repayable semi-annually over 12 years and
bear interest at 4.2%, was replaced with two unsecured term loan
facilities. The first facility is a euro-denominated $435 million
term loan facility, bearing interest at 3.9% and is repayable
semi-annually over 12 years. On September 18, 2009, we
borrowed under this facility, the proceeds of which were used to
pay for a portion of Carnival Dream’s purchase price.
The second facility is a euro-denominated $283 million term loan
facility that has two tranches. The first tranche is for $145
million. On September 18, 2009, we borrowed under this
tranche, the proceeds of which were also used to pay for a portion
of Carnival Dream’s purchase price. This tranche bears
interest at EURIBOR plus 55 bps and matures in September 2014. The
second tranche is for $138 million, and we anticipate drawing this
in February 2010 for general corporate purposes. This second
tranche will bear interest at EURIBOR plus 300 bps and it will
mature four years from the date of funding. In August 2009,
we entered into an unsecured three-year $100 million multi-currency
bilateral revolver, which has an undrawn commitment fee of 40 bps
and serves as back-up liquidity to our principal
revolver. In September
2009, we repaid $526 million of euro-denominated debt prior to its
March 31, 2010 maturity date.

Debt Short-term debt consisted of the following: August 29,

2008 JPMorgan credit facility $ 325 $ 162 $ 1,173 Europe receivables financing agreement    Europe revolving credit facility 730 584 299 Canada revolving demand facility  2  China revolving demand facilities 36 35 43 Total short-term debt $ 1,091 $ 783 $ 1,515 Europe Receivables
Financing Agreement In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, a subsidiary of Best
Buy Europe (the Subsidiary) entered into a £350 (or $573)
receivables financing agreement (the Agreement) with Barclays
Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and a syndication of banks to
finance the working capital needs of Best Buy Europe. The Agreement
is secured by certain network carrier receivables of the
Subsidiary. Availability on the facility is based on a percentage
of the available acceptable receivables, as defined in the
Agreement. Although no amount was outstanding under the
Agreement at August 29, 2009, in September 2009, we drew
the full amount available of £245 (or $401) on the Agreement. The Agreement expires on July 3, 2012. Interest rates under the Agreement are variable, based on
the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin
of 3.00%, with a commitment fee of 1.5% on unused available
capacity. The Agreement also required an initial commitment
fee of 2.75%. The Agreement is not guaranteed by Best Buy
Co., Inc., or any subsidiary nor does it provide for any
recourse to Best Buy Co., Inc. The Agreement contains
customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things,
these covenants restrict or prohibit the Subsidiarys ability to
incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur additional
encumbrances on its receivables, make material changes in the
nature of its business, dispose of material assets, make
guarantees, or engage in a change in control transaction. The
Agreement also contains covenants that require the Subsidiary to
comply with a maximum annual leverage ratio, a minimum annual
interest coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges coverage
ratio. Europe Revolving
Credit Facility In connection with a £475 (or $777) revolving credit
facility available to Best Buy Europe with CPW as lender, Best Buy
Co., Inc. is named as guarantor, up to 50% of the amount outstanding. Concurrent with entering into the Agreement described above, we amended the revolving credit facility to decrease the amount available under the revolving credit facility by the amount available under the Agreement. The related guarantee by Best Buy Co., Inc. was similarly reduced. The revolving credit facility expires in March 2013. Long-Term
Debt Long-term debt consisted of the following: August 29, 2009 February 28,
2009 August 30, 2008 6.75% notes $ 500 $ 500 $ 500 Convertible debentures 402 402 402 Financing lease obligations 195 200 198 Capital lease obligations 55 65 63 Other debt 4 13 12 Total long-term debt 1,156 1,180 1,175 Less: current portion (45 ) (54 ) (39 ) Total long-term debt, less current portion $ 1,111 $ 1,126 $ 1,136 The fair value of long-term debt approximated $1,190,
$1,122 and $1,183 at August 29, 2009, February 28, 2009,
and August 30, 2008, respectively, based primarily on the ask
prices quoted from external sources, compared with carrying values
of $1,156, $1,180 and $1,175, respectively. Other than as referred to above, see Note 6, Debt,

2,2009-09-18,1048911,XBRL," (4) Financing Arrangements On July 31, 2009, we filed an updated shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to sell, in one or more future offe
rings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock. During the first quarter of 2010, we repaid our $500 million 5.50% notes that matured on August 15, 2009 using cash from operations and a portion of the proceeds of our January 2009 $1 billion senior unsecured debt offering. A new three-year $1 billion revolving credit facility was executed in July 2009, which replaced our prior $1 billion revolving credit facility. The new revolving credit agreement is available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This revolving credit agreement expires in July 2012. O
ur revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of adjusted debt (long-term debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus six times rentals and landing fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus total common stockholders’ investment) that does not exceed 0.7 to 1.0. This covenant was unchanged from our prior revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratio of adjusted debt to capital was 0.5 at August 31, 2009. We are in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants of our revolving credit agreement and do not expect the covenants to affect our operations. As of August 31, 2009, no commercial paper was outstanding and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit facility was available for future borrowings. Long-term debt, exclusive of capital leases, had carrying values of $1.8 billion compared with an estimated fair value of $2.1 billion at August 31, 2009, and $2.3 billion compared with an estimated fair value of $2.4 billion at May 31, 2009. The estimated fair values were determined based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities."

8,2009-10-08,77476,XBRL," Debt Obligations In the first
quarter of 2009, we issued $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes,
bearing interest at 3.75% per year and maturing in 2014. We
used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes for general
corporate purposes. As of
September 5, 2009, short-term obligations totaled $0.5
billion, of which $0.2 billion was comprised of commercial
paper. In the third
quarter of 2009, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving
credit agreement which enables us to borrow up to $1.975 billion,
subject to customary terms and conditions, and expires in June
2010. We may request renewal of this facility for an additional
364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan
for a period of up to one year, which would mature no later than
June 2011. This agreement replaced a $1.8 billion 364-day unsecured
revolving credit agreement we entered into during the fourth
quarter of 2008. Funds borrowed under this agreement may be used to
repay outstanding commercial paper issued by us or our subsidiaries
and for other general corporate purposes, including working
capital, capital investments and acquisitions. This agreement is in
addition to our existing $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit
agreement which expires in 2012. Our lines of credit remain unused
as of September 5, 2009. We have
received commitment letters pursuant to which, subject to the
conditions set forth therein, a group of lenders have committed to
provide up to $4.0 billion of loans under a bridge facility. The
bridge facility will be available to us, as the borrower, on a
revolving basis for a period of 364 days from the closing date of
the Mergers (as defined in Acquisition of Common Stock of PBG
and PAS). The bridge loans, if required, will be used to
finance a portion of the purchase price for the Mergers and to pay
related fees and expenses. We will be required to prepay the bridge
loans under specified circumstances, including upon specified
non-ordinary course asset sales, specified incurrences of debt, and
equity issuances by us or our subsidiaries and upon the issuance of
debt securities for the purpose of refinancing the bridge facility.
Documentation governing the bridge facility has not been finalized.
Accordingly, the actual terms of these financing arrangements may
differ from those described herein.

Note 12. Financing Arrangements The Company has a $500 million committed global syndicated revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2012. Interest rates under this facility vary depending upon: • The amount borrowed; • The Company’s public debt rating by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch; and • At the Company’s option, rates tied to the agent bank’s prime rate or, for U.S. Dollar and Great Britain Pounds Sterling borrowings, the London Interbank Offered Rate and for Euro Dollar borrowings, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate. At September 30, 2009, there were no borrowings and $61.4 million in letters of credit outstanding under the facility. At December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings and $35.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under the facility. The level of unused borrowing capacity varies from time to time depending, in part, upon the Company’s compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement, including the consolidated net worth requirement and maximum leverage ratio. The Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants. Under the most restrictive of these covenants, $2,003.6 million of income retained in the business and additional paid-in capital was free from such limitations at September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009, the Company had borrowing capacity under this facility of $438.6 million, after reductions for borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the facility. At September 30, 2009, the Company had letters of credit and bank guarantees of $89.3 million, inclusive of $61.4 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Company’s syndicated revolving credit facility, as discussed above. At September 30, 2009, the Company also maintained $75 million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and $162.2 million of uncommitted and committed foreign working capital facilities with various banks to meet short-term borrowing requirements. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there were $36.7 million and $37.7 million, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under these facilities. These credit facilities are provided by a small number of commercial banks that also provide the Company with committed credit through the syndicated revolving credit facility described above and with various cash management, trust and other services. In February 2009, the Company issued $300 million principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2019, which were issued below par. The discount will be amortized over the life of the senior notes. In addition, the Company deferred approximately $2 million of transaction costs which will be amortized over the life of the 6.125% senior notes. Long-term Debt Repayments The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the $300 million senior notes to repay $120 million for the 6.6% senior notes, which matured on May 15, 2009. Lease Commitments The Company leases certain of its office and manufacturing facilities as well as machinery and equipment, including corporate aircraft, under various committed lease arrangements provided by financial institutions. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases were $165.1 million at September 30, 2009. One of these arrangements allows the Company, rather than the lessor, to claim a deduction for tax depreciation on the asset and allows the Company to lease a corporate aircraft with a total commitment amount of $43.8 million. This lease is priced at a spread over LIBOR. Lease payments under this arrangement are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2011. "

The Company was in compliance with all such covenants and provisions for all periods presented. In May 2009, the Company issued $1,000 in senior notes, which rank equally with all of the Company’s other senior unsecured indebtedness. In conjunction with the debt issuance, the Company paid off $191 of 7.50% Debentures due May 2037 that contained put options exercised in May 2009, early redeemed $60 of 6.77% Medium Term Notes due July 2009 and purchased pursuant to a tender offer $232 of 7.875% Notes due August 2009, $177 of 6.95% Notes due August 2009 and $110 of 8.35% Notes due May 2010 for an aggregate payment of $777 in cash. The remainder of the debt issuance proceeds was used to reduce the Revolving Credit Facility. In May 2009, the Company amended and extended its 364-day accounts receivable securitization program. The Company can borrow up to $200 on a revolving basis, with borrowings secured by eligible accounts receivable, which remain under the Company’s control. Facility fees under this program range from 0.75 percent to 2.50 percent, based on the Company’s credit ratings. The facility fee in effect on September 12, 2009, based on the Company’s current credit ratings, was 1.00 percent.

Due to the Company’s intent to renew the facility or refinance it with the Revolving Credit Facility, the facility is classified in Long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 12, 2009, the Company had $165 of debt, excluding the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, with current maturities that are classified in Long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the Company’s intent to refinance such obligations with the Revolving Credit Facility or other long-term debt.

The 2014 Senior Notes accrue interest at the rate of 8.25% per annum, payable semi-annually and, as a result of the discount, have a weighted average effective interest rate of 8.25%. Debt issuance costs of approximately $5 were deferred. The 2014 Senior Notes rank equally with our other existing senior unsecured indebtedness. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. Zero Coupon Notes In July 2009, we repaid a $300 Zero Coupon Note. The total repayment of $336 included interest accretion of $36. This Note was repaid when the holders exercised a put option to redeem the bond prior to the scheduled maturity date of July 30, 2022. In August 2009, we repaid a $100 Zero Coupon Note. The total repayment of $112 included interest accre
tion of $12. This Note was repaid when the holder exercised a put option to redeem the bond prior to the scheduled maturity date of August 29, 2022. Credit Facility In April 2009, we amended our $2 billion Credit Facility with affiliates of Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as joint lead arrangers an
d joint bookrunners, and a group of lenders. The amendment increased the permitted leverage ratio (principal debt/consolidated EBITDA) to 4.25x through June 30, 2010 and retained 3.75x thereafter. The amendment included a re-pricing of the Credit Facility such that borrowings will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread (including fees) that varies between 2.50% and 4.50%, subject to our credit rating at the time of borrowing. In October 2009, in connection with entering into the Bridge Loan Facility as part of the acquisition of ACS, we again amended our $2 billion Credit Facility. The amendment extended the permitted leverage ratio of 4.25x through September 30, 2010, which will change to 4.00x through December 31, 2010, and to 3.75x thereafter. The amendment also included the following changes: · The definition of principal debt was changed such that prior to the closing of the ACS acquisition, it will be calculated net of cash proceeds from certain debt issuances associated with the pre-funding of the ACS acquisition. · A portion of the Credit Facility that had a maturity date of April 30, 2012 was extended to a maturity date of April 30, 2013, consistent with the remainder of the facility. Accordingly, after this amendment, approximately $1.6 billion, or approximately 80% of the Credit Facility, has a maturity date of April 30, 2013. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable all-in spread for the Credit Facility would be 3.50%. "

per $1,000 (in whole dollars) principal amount of notes (89,407,210
shares), equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $6.43
per share, subject to adjustment, as defined in the convertible
notes. Other than receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares,
holders do not have the option to receive cash instead of shares of
common stock upon conversion. Accrued and unpaid interest that
exists upon conversion of a note will be deemed paid by the
delivery of shares of Alcoa’s common stock and no cash
payment or additional shares will be given to holders. On the issuance
date of the convertible notes, the market price of Alcoa’s
common stock was above the stated conversion price of $6.43
creating a beneficial conversion option to the holders, as the
convertible notes were “in-the-money.” The beneficial
conversion option is defined as a benefit provided to the holders
in the form of non-cash interest expense to the Company. As a
result, Alcoa recorded a $66 increase to additional capital and a
corresponding decrease in the carrying value of the convertible
notes representing the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion
option. The $66 decrease will be amortized to interest expense over
the five-year term of the convertible notes effectively accreting
the carrying value of the convertible notes to $575 by the stated
maturity date. If Alcoa
undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the convertible
notes, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a
portion of their notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid
interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Such a
repurchase will be made in cash. The convertible
notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of
payment to any of Alcoa’s future indebtedness that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the convertible notes
and equally in right of payment with all of Alcoa’s existing
and future unsecured indebtedness and liabilities that are not so
subordinated. The convertible notes effectively rank junior to any
secured indebtedness of Alcoa to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated
to all debt and other liabilities of Alcoa’s
subsidiaries. The net
proceeds from the convertible notes ($562) and the issuance of
common stock (see Note L) were used to prepay the $1,300
outstanding under Alcoa’s 364-day revolving credit facility
(see below). The remaining net proceeds were used for general
corporate purposes. During the
first quarter of 2009, Alcoa borrowed $1,300 under the $1,900
364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility to support its
operations. The $1,300 was repaid on March 24, 2009 with the
net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes (see above)
and common stock (see Note L). There were no amounts outstanding
under the $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility
at September 30, 2009. Also during the
first quarter of 2009, Alcoa Alumínio (Alumínio) borrowed
a total of $255 in new loans with a weighted-average interest rate
of 5.25% and a weighted-average maturity of 276 days from six
financial institutions. In the second quarter of 2009, $55 was
repaid and a new $55 was borrowed. During the third quarter of
2009, Alumínio repaid the $255 in outstanding borrowings. The
purpose of these borrowings was to support Alumínio’s
export operations. During the 2009
nine-month period, Alumínio borrowed $228 (R$409) under the
existing BNDES (Brazil’s National Bank for Economic and
Social Development) loans related to the Juruti bauxite mine
development, São Luís refinery expansion, and Estreito
hydroelectric power project. In September 2009, Alumínio began
the repayment of four of the subloans related to the Juruti project
in the amount of $4 (R$7). Total borrowings under these BNDES loans
were $943 (R$1,691) as of September 30, 2009. In May 2009,
Alumínio entered into two new loan agreements (the
“Loans”) with BNDES related to the Juruti bauxite mine
development and the São Luís refinery
expansion. The first loan
provides for a commitment of $321 (R$750), which is divided into
six subloans, and will be used to pay for certain expenditures of
the Juruti bauxite mine development. Interest on two of the
subloans totaling $257 (R$600) is a USD rate of interest equal to
the average cost incurred by BNDES in raising capital outside of
Brazil, 4.03% as of September 30, 2009, plus a
weighted-average margin of 1.69%. Interest on four of the subloans
totaling $64 (R$150) is a BRL rate of interest equal to
BNDES’ long-term interest rate, 6.00% as of
September 30, 2009, plus a weighted-average margin of 1.59%.
As of September 30, 2009, Alumínio borrowed $126 (R$225)
and $41 (R$73) and the weighted-average interest rate was 5.88% and
7.59% for the subloans totaling $257 (R$600) and the subloans
totaling $64 (R$150), respectively. The second loan
provides for a commitment of $86 (R$200), which is divided into
four subloans, and will be used to pay for certain expenditures of
the São Luís refinery expansion. Interest on two of the
subloans totaling $69 (R$160) is a USD rate of interest equal to
the average cost incurred by BNDES in raising capital outside of
Brazil plus a weighted-average margin of 1.70%. Interest on two of
the subloans totaling $17 (R$40) is a BRL rate of interest equal to
BNDES’ long-term interest rate plus a weighted-average margin
of 1.70%. As of September 30, 2009, Alumínio borrowed $33
(R$60) and $11 (R$19) and the weighted-average interest rate was
5.89% and 7.70% for the subloans totaling $69 (R$160) and the
subloans totaling $17 (R$40), respectively. Principal and
interest on the Loans are payable monthly beginning in November
2010 and ending in April 2016. Prior to the beginning payment date,
interest is payable quarterly on borrowed amounts. The Loans may be
repaid early without penalty with the approval of BNDES once the
portions of the growth projects related to these Loans are
completed. Also, the Loans include a financial covenant that states
that Alcoa must maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5 or
lower.

4. Debt Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper As of September 30, 2009, the Company had borrowing capacity of up to $1.2 billion under its long-term revolving bank credit facility, which expires in September 2012. Annual facility fees are currently 0.08 percent for the facility. The rate is subject to change based upon changes in BNSF’s senior unsecured debt ratings. Borrowing rates are based upon (i) LIBOR plus a spread determined by BNSF’s senior unsecured debt ratings; (ii) money market rates offered at the option of the lenders; or (iii) an alternate base rate. BNSF must maintain compliance with certain financial covenants under its revolving bank credit facility. At September 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. At September 30, 2009, there were no bank borrowings against the revolving credit agreement. BNSF issues commercial paper from time to time that is supported by the revolving bank credit facility. Outstanding commercial paper balances reduce the amount of borrowings available under this agreement. The classification of commercial paper is determined by the Company’s ability and intent to use long-term or short-term funding sources to settle the obligations at maturity. At December 31, 2008, the Company classified outstanding commercial paper as long-term debt. No commercial paper was outstanding as of September 30, 2009. Notes and Debentures In September 2009, BNSF issued $750 million of 4.7 percent notes due October 1, 2019. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes are being used for general corporate purposes which may include, but are not limited to, working capital, capital expenditures, repurchase of common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program, and repayment of outstanding indebtedness. At September 30, 2009, $750 million remained authorized by the Board of Directors to be issued through a SEC debt shelf registration statement. Equipment Obligation In July 2009, BNSF Railway entered into an 18-year equipment obligation totaling $75 million to finance locomotives and railcars. Capital Leases During the first nine months of 2009, BNSF entered into a 12-year capital lease to finance $368 million of locomotives and freight cars. Additionally, BNSF entered into capital leases totaling $96 million to finance maintenance of way and other vehicles and equipment with lease terms of three to seven years. Financing Obligation In 2005, the Company commenced the construction of an intermodal facility that it intended to sell to a third party and subsequently lease back. As of September 30, 2009, construction of the facility was completed for a cost of approximately $160 million. All improvements have been sold to the third party and BNSF leased the facility from the third party for 20 years. This sale leaseback transaction was accounted for as a financing obligation due to continuing involvement. The outflows from the construction of the facility were classified as investing activities, and the inflows from the associated financing proceeds were classified as financing activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fair Value of Debt Instruments At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the fair value of BNSF’s debt, excluding capital leases and interest rate hedges, was $9,578 million and $8,323 million, respectively, while the book value was $8,772 million and $8,274 million, respectively. The fair value of BNSF’s debt is primarily based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or on the current rates that would be offered to BNSF for debt of the same remaining maturities. The book value of commercial paper approximates fair value due to its short maturity. Guarantees As of September 30, 2009, BNSF Railway has not been called upon to perform under the guarantees specifically disclosed in this footnote and does not anticipate a significant performance risk in the foreseeable future. Debt and other obligations of non-consolidated entities guaranteed by the Company as of September 30, 2009, were as follows (dollars in millions): Guarantees BNSF Principal Maximum Maximum Remaining Ownership Amount Future Recourse Term Capitalized Percentage Guaranteed Payments Amounta (in years) Obligations Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. 0.5% $

– a Reflects the maximum amount the Company could recover from a third party other than the counterparty. b Reflects capitalized obligations that are recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. c Reflects the asset and corresponding liability for the fair value of these guarantees required by authoritative accounting guidance related to guarantees. d There is no cap to the liability that can be sought from BNSF for BNSF’s negligence or the negligence of the indemnified party. However, BNSF could receive reimbursement from certain insurance policies if the liability exceeds a certain amount. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BNSF Railway, has a guarantee in connection with its remaining special limited partnership interest in Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines Partners, L.P. (SFPP), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., to be paid only upon default by the partnership. All obligations with respect to the guarantee will cease upon termination of ownership rights, which would occur upon a put notice issued by BNSF or the exercise of the call rights by the general partners of SFPP. Kansas City Terminal Intermodal Transportation Corporation BNSF Railway and another major railroad jointly and severally guarantee $48 million of debt of Kansas City Terminal Intermodal Transportation Corporation, the proceeds of which were used to finance construction of a double track grade separation bridge in Kansas City, Missouri, which is operated and used by Kansas City Terminal Railway Company (KCTRC). BNSF Railway has a 25 percent ownership in KCTRC, accounts for its interest using the equity method of accounting and would be required to fund a portion of the remaining obligation upon default by the original debtor. Westside Intermodal Transportation Corporation and The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas BNSF Railway has outstanding guarantees of $49 million of debt, the proceeds of which were used to finance construction of a bridge that connects BNSF Railway’s Argentine Yard in Kansas City, Kansas, with the KCTRC mainline tracks in Kansas City, Missouri. The bridge is operated by KCTRC, and payments related to BNSF Railway’s guarantee of this obligation would only be called for upon default by the original debtor. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP In the third quarter of 2007, BNSF Railway entered into an indemnity agreement with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP (Chevron Phillips), granting certain rights of indemnity from BNSF Railway, in order to facilitate access to a new storage facility. Under certain circumstances, payment under this obligation may be required in the event Chevron Phillips were to incur certain liabilities or other incremental costs resulting from trackage access. Residual Value Guarantees (RVG) In the normal course of business, the Company enters into leases in which it guarantees the residual value of certain leased equipment. Some of these leases have renewal or purchase options, or both, that the Company may exercise at the end of the lease term. If the Company elects not to exercise these options, it may be required to pay the lessor an amount not exceeding the RVG. The amount of any payment is contingent upon the actual residual value of the leased equipment. Some of these leases also require the lessor to pay the Company any surplus if the actual residual value of the leased equipment is over the RVG. These guarantees will expire between 2010 and 2011. The maximum future payments, as disclosed in the Guarantees table above, represent the undiscounted maximum amount that the Company could be required to pay in the event the Company did not exercise its renewal option and the fair market value of the equipment had significantly declined. BNSF does not anticipate such a large reduction in the fair market value of the leased equipment. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had recorded a $68 million asset and corresponding liability for the fair value of RVG. All Other As of September 30, 2009, BNSF guaranteed $4 million of other debt and leases. BNSF holds a performance bond and has the option to sub-lease property to recover up to $1 million of the $4 million of guarantees. These guarantees expire between 2011 and 2013. Other than as discussed above, there is no collateral held by a third party that the Company could obtain and liquidate to recover any amounts paid under the above guarantees. Other than as discussed above, none of the guarantees are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. The Company does not expect performance under these guarantees to have a material effect on the Company in the foreseeable future. Indemnities In the ordinary course of business, BNSF enters into agreements with third parties that include indemnification clauses. In general, these clauses are customary for the types of agreements in which they are included. At times, these clauses may involve indemnification for the acts of the Company, its employees and agents, indemnification for another party’s acts, indemnification for future events, indemnification based upon a certain standard of performance, indemnification for liabilities arising out of the Company’s use of leased equipment or other property, or other types of indemnification. Due to the uncertainty of whether events which would trigger the indemnification obligations would ever occur, the Company does not believe that these indemnity agreements will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additionally, the Company believes that, due to lack of historical payment experience, the fair value of indemnities cannot be estimated with any amount of certainty and that the fair value of any such amount would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Agreements that contain unique circumstances, particularly agreements that contain guarantees that indemnify for another party’s acts are disclosed separately if appropriate. Unless separately disclosed above, no fair value liability related to indemnities has been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. "

Note 21. Short-Term
Borrowings and Long-Term Debt
Short-term borrowings were
$286 million and $154 million at September 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively, and consist primarily of
outstanding bank drafts.
As part of the Medarex,
Inc. acquisition in September 2009 (see “—Note 5.
Medarex, Inc. Acquisition,”), the Company’s
consolidated financial statements now reflect Medarex’s
outstanding 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2011
(the “2.25% Notes”). These notes, originally
convertible into Medarex shares at the rate of $72.9129 per each
$1,000 principal amount ($13.72 per share), were adjusted into the
right to receive $1,167 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount
outstanding (the equivalent of $16 per share). Short-term
borrowings include $88 million related to these notes as of
September 30, 2009.
As of September 30,
2009, the 1.81% Yen Notes due 2010 amounting to $38 million were
reclassified to short-term borrowings.

6,585 The increase in the Euro
Notes due 2016 and 2021 was due to the U.S. dollar weakening as of
September 30, 2009 from December 31, 2008.
In the third quarter of
2009, the Company repurchased approximately $35 million principal
amount of its 7.15% Notes due 2023 and $18 million of its 6.8%
Notes due 2026 for $44 million and $21 million, respectively. The
loss attributed to the transactions amounted to $4 million, which
also included the termination of approximately $18 million notional
amount of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps associated with the
7.15% Notes due 2023 for proceeds of $3 million.
In June 2009, the Company
repurchased approximately $63 million principal amount of its
5.875% Notes due 2036 for $67 million. The total gain attributed to
this transaction amounted to $11 million, which also included the
termination of approximately $35 million notional amount of
fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps for proceeds of $5
million.
In June 2009, the Company
executed several fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to convert
$200 million of its 5.45% Notes due 2018 from fixed rate debt to
variable rate debt. In April 2009, the Company executed several
fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to convert $597 million of
its 5.25% Notes due 2013 from fixed rate debt to variable rate
debt. In January 2009, the Company terminated $1,061 million
notional amount of fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements
for proceeds of $187 million. The basis adjustment on the debt,
which was equal to the proceeds from this swap termination, is
being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the
remaining life of the underlying debt. For further discussion of
the Company’s interest rate swaps, refer to
“—Note 22. Financial Instruments.” In February 2009, Mead
Johnson & Company as borrower and Mead Johnson as
guarantor, both of which are indirect, majority-owned subsidiaries
of the Company, entered into a three-year syndicated revolving
credit facility agreement. The facility is unsecured and matures in
February 2012, subject to annual extensions if sufficient lenders
agree. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of
credit permitted at any one time is $410 million, which may be
increased up to $500 million, at the option of Mead Johnson and
with the consent of the lenders, subject to customary conditions
contained in the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding
under this revolving credit facility at September 30,
2009.
The Company has a $2.0
billion, revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders
maturing in December 2011, which is extendable with the consent of
the lenders. This facility contains customary terms and conditions,
including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated
debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each
quarter. The Company has been in compliance with this covenant
since the inception of this new facility. There were no borrowings
outstanding under this revolving credit facility at
September 30, 2009.

the Company’s debt financing, please refer to Note 8 of the
Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the description
of the 2019 Notes set forth below. As of October 2, 2009, the
Company’s 5.625% notes due 2018 had an approximate fair value
of $549 million and the 5.4% notes due 2019 had an approximate fair
value of $811 million. The fair value of the Company’s 4.5%
guaranteed Eurobond Notes due July 22, 2013 approximated its
carrying value as of October 2, 2009.
The Company satisfies its
short-term liquidity needs primarily through operating cash flow,
available cash and issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial
paper. As of October 2, 2009, the commercial paper outstanding
under the Company’s U.S. dollar commercial paper program had
a weighted average interest rate of 0.18% and a weighted average
maturity of approximately 25 days. There was no outstanding
Euro-denominated commercial paper as of October 2, 2009.
Credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by an
unsecured $1.45 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility
that expires on April 25, 2012 and an unsecured $75 million
multicurrency revolving credit facility that expires on May 3,
2010.
The Company has a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that
registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock,
preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts
and units for future issuance. In March 2009, the Company used the
shelf registration statement to complete an underwritten public
offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40% senior
unsecured notes due 2019. The notes were issued at 99.93% of their
principal amount. The net proceeds, after expenses and the
underwriters’ discount, were approximately $745 million. A
portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the
Company’s outstanding commercial paper with the balance of
the net proceeds invested in cash and equivalents and expected to
be used for general corporate purposes, which may include
acquisitions, further refinancing of debt, working capital, share
repurchases and capital expenditures. The Company may redeem the
notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price
equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be
redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 40 basis points.
If the Company experiences a change of control and a rating
downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following
the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to
repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest. The Company has classified
the borrowings under the commercial paper programs at
October 2, 2009 as long-term borrowings in the accompanying
Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent
and ability, as supported by availability under the above mentioned
credit facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one
year from the balance sheet date.

The 2009 Senior Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywell’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywell’s subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1.5 billion, offset by $12 million in discount and issuance costs.
font> We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. In April 2009, we modified the terms of the trade accounts receivable program to permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. This modification will provide additional flexibility in the management of the receivable portfolio and will also require the receivables i
n the program to remain on the Company balance sheet. As a result, $500 million of program receivables were reflected as Accounts, notes and other receivables with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2009, these short-term borrowings were $200 million. This modification also results in the program costs being recognized as Interest and other financial charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations on a prospective basis. "

1,790,668 Bank Debt In October 2006, we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank facility, which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility, which is secured by substantially all of our assets. The bank credit facility provides for an initial commitment equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base. On September 30, 2009, the borrowing base was $1.5 billion and our facility amount was $1.25 billion. The bank credit facility provides for a borrowing base subject to redeterminations semi-annually and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. As part of our semi-annual bank review completed September 30, 2009, our borrowing base was reaffirmed at $1.5 billion and our facility amount was also reaffirmed at $1.25 billion. Our current bank group is comprised of twenty-six commercial banks each holding between 2.4% and 5.0% of the total facility. Of those twenty-six banks, thirteen are domestic banks and thirteen are foreign banks or wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign banks. The facility amount may be increased up to the borrowing base amount with twenty days notice, subject to payment of a mutually acceptable commitment fee to those banks agreeing to participate in the facility amount increase. At September 30, 2009, the outstanding balance under the bank credit facility was $398.0 million and there was $852.0 million of borrowing capacity available under the facility amount. The loan matures October 25, 2012. Borrowing under the bank credit facility can either be the Alternate Base Rate (as defined) plus a spread ranging from 0.875% to 1.625% or LIBOR borrowings at the adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined) plus a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.5%. The applicable spread is dependent upon borrowings relative to the borrowing base. We may elect, from time to time, to convert all or any part of our LIBOR loans to base rate loans or to convert all or any part of the base rate loans to LIBOR loans. The weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2009 compared to 4.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2008. The weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 compared to 4.7% in the same period of the prior year. A commitment fee is paid on the undrawn balance based on an annual rate of between 0.375% and 0.50%. At September 30, 2009, the commitment fee was 0.375% and the interest rate margin was 1.75% on our LIBOR loans and 0.875% on our base rate loans. At October 20, 2009, the interest rate (including applicable margin) was 2.1%. Senior Subordinated Notes In May 2009, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019 (“8.0% Notes”). The 8.0% Notes were issued at a discount, which is being amortized over the life of the 8.0% Notes. Interest on the 8.0% Notes is payable semi-annually, in May and November, and is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. We may redeem the 8.0% Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2014, at redemption prices of 104.0% of the principal amount as of May 15, 2014 declining to 100.0% on May 15, 2017 and thereafter. Before May 15, 2012, we may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 8.0% Notes at a redemption price equal to 108.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings, provided that at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 8.0% Notes remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and also provided such redemption shall occur within 60 days of the date of the closing of the equity offering. Debt Covenants Our bank credit facility contains negative covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to pay cash dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into certain hedging contracts, change the nature of our business or operations, merge, consolidate, or make investments. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0 and a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with our covenants under the bank credit facility at September 30, 2009. The indentures governing our senior subordinated notes contain various restrictive covenants that are substantially identical to each other and may limit our ability to, among other things, pay cash dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, or change the nature of our business. At September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with these covenants. "

Companys zero coupon convertible notes with an effective yield of 4.17% and a remaining principal balance of $141 million matured and were fully paid. Senior Debt Issuance. On June 2, 2009, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% senior notes that will mature on June 2, 2019. The net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately $494 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 2 and December 2 of each year, commencing December 2, 2009. The senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Companys option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current treasury rate (as defined) plus 35 basis points for the senior notes. "
8,2009-10-22,100885,XBRL,"13. DebtCredit Facilities – At September 30, 2009, we had $1.9 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility (the facility). The facility is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. We did not draw on the facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The facility requires us to maintain a debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 (and at all times during the first, second, and third quarters
), we were in compliance with this covenant. The definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio includes, among other things, certain credit arrangements, capital leases, guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of ERISA. At September 30, 2009, the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to $33 billion of debt (as defined in the facility), and we had $10.7 billion of debt (as defined in the facility) outstanding at that date. Under our current capital plans, we expect to continue to satisfy the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio; however, many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future. The facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. The facility also includes a $75 million cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision. The term of the facility will expire in April 2012, and we currently intend to replace the facility with a substantially similar credit agreement on or before the expiration date, which is consistent with our past practices with respect to our credit facilities.At September 30, 2009, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Outstanding commercial paper balances are supported by our revolving credit facility but do not reduce the amount of borrowings available under the facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we issued $100 million of commercial paper and repaid $200 million. Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings – Under our current shelf registration statement, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings.On February 20, 2009, we issued a total of $750 million of unsecured fixed-rate notes under our shelf registration statement. We issued $350 million of 5.125% notes due February 15, 2014 and $400 million of 6.125% notes due February 15, 2020. The net proceeds from this offering are for general corporate purposes.We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration, and, therefore, we may issue additional debt securities at any time. At September 30, 2009, we had remaining authority from our Board of Directors to issue up to $2.25 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration.As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we have reclassified as long-term debt approximately $320 million and $400 million, respectively, of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance. This reclassification reflects our abi
lity and intent to refinance any short-term borrowings and certain current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis.During the second quarter of 2009, we restructured lease agreements for 813 locomotives resulting in a change in lease classification from operating to capital. As part of the restructuring arrangements, we received $87 million in cash consideration. We recorded capital lease assets of approximately $742 million and related capital lease obligations totaling approximately $843 million. Included in our capital lease obligations is the $87 million in cash consideration and $14 million of accrued operating lease payables that were reclassified as part of our capital lease obligations. Capital lease obligations are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as debt.On October 15, 2009, we entered into a capital lease agreement for 44 locomotives with a total equipment cost of $100 million. The lessor purchase
d the 44 locomotives from the Corporation and subsequently leased the locomotives back to the Railroad. These capital lease obligations will be reported in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as debt at December 31, 2009."

Debt Short-Term Borrowings: At September 30, 2009, we had short-term borrowings of $174.5 million, of which $31.0 million was bank overdrafts of our international subsidiaries and $143.5 million was commercial paper borrowings. The bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to our bank agreements. Lines of Credit: We have a $2.5 billion credit facility expiring on June 23, 2011. We have the ability to classify borrowings under this facility as long-term debt. Our credit facility provides back-up liquidity in the even
t that any of our convertible notes are put back to us, as well as support for our commercial paper. At September 30, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. The gross amount of borrowings and repayments under the credit facility during the first nine months of 2009 was approximately $22 billion, with an average term of approximately 11 days. The gross amount of commercial paper issued and redeemed under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2009 was approximately $10 billion, with an average term of approximately 3 days. Depending on market conditions at the time, we either issue commercial paper or borrow under our credit facility or on our uncommitted lines of credit to manage short-term cash requirements primarily related to changes in our day-to-day working capital requirements. Long-Term Debt and Convertible Debt: On February 9, 2009, holders of $841.2 million aggregate principal amount of our Liquid Yield Option Notes due February 7, 2031 (“2031 Notes”) put their notes to us for purchase at par and $5.8 million of the 2031 Notes remain outstanding. We borrowed $814.4 million under our credit facility and received $26.8 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 Notes. We repurchased and retired $295.2 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes that had been put. We loaned the partnership $493.4 million and contributed $25.8 million as our equity investment. The partnership used the proceeds from the loan which it combined with the total contributed equity to purchase the remaining $546.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes that were put. The partnersh
ip purchased the 2031 Notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions warrant. The partnership is consolidated in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation, and as a result, all of the 2031 Notes held by the partnership are eliminated in consolidation. On February 12, 2009, we paid a supplemental interest payment of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2031 Notes. The partnership that financed the purchase of $546.0 million of our 2031 Notes on our behalf was paid a supplemental interest payment of $27.3 million and the other noteholders who did not put their notes were paid a supplemental interest payment of $0.3 million. The loan made to the partnership bears interest at 3.35% per annum. On consolidation, interest income from the loan to the partnership offsets interest expense from the amortization of the supplemental inter
est payment made to the partnership resulting in net interest expense of $1.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. On July 1, 2009, we issued $500 million principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due July 15, 2019 (“2019 Notes”). The proceeds from the issuance before deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses were $496.7 million. The 2019 Notes were issued by Omnicom Group Inc. and two of its wholly owned finance subsidiaries, Omnicom Capital Inc. and Omnicom Finance Inc., as co-obligors. The 2019 Notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co-obligors. In connection with the issuance of the 2019 Notes, we entered into a same-day forward treasury lock agreement to hedge the variability in the expected future cash flows attributable to the risk associated with a change in the designated benchmark treasury rate that was used to price the notes. This agreement was designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. Simultaneously with the pricing of the notes, we terminated and settled the hedge and realized a $2.9 million loss that is included in comprehensive income and is being amortized over the term of the 2019 Notes. On August 6, 2009, we paid a supplemental interest payment of $7.6 million to holders of our Zero Yield Zero Coupon Convertible Notes due July 31, 2032 (“2032 Notes”) who did not put their notes back to us. A total of $474.3 million of our 2032 Notes were put back to us for repurchase and a total of $252.7 million of our 2032 Notes rema
in outstanding. The supplemental interest payment is being amortized ratably over a twelve-month period to the next put date. Long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 consisted of the following (dollars in millions): 2009 2008 &lt

Debt
In June 2009, PPG entered
into a $400 million three year unsecured term loan. During the
third quarter, $116 million of the proceeds from this term loan
were used to retire our 7.05% Notes due 2009; the remainder of the
loan proceeds of approximately $284 million were used to retire
outstanding amounts under our €650 million revolving
credit facility in the second and third quarters. The principal
amount of this term loan is due in three years and the interest
rate is variable and is based on a spread over LIBOR.
During 2009, the Company
retired over $350 million related to the €650 million
revolving credit facility. The Company currently has $271 million
outstanding under this facility. In addition, the Company retired
the entire outstanding balance of U.S. commercial paper of $222
million as well as approximately $196 million of other short term
debt.
In December 2007, PPG
issued $617 million of commercial paper and borrowed $1,056 million
(€717 million) under a €1 billion bridge loan agreement
with multiple lenders and Credit Suisse as administrative agent for
those lenders. The proceeds from these borrowings were deposited
into escrow in December 2007. Upon closing of the SigmaKalon
acquisition on January 2, 2008, these amounts were released
from escrow and paid to the seller. Also, in January 2008, PPG
borrowed $1,143 million, representing the remaining $417 million
(€283 million) available under the €1 billion bridge
loan agreement and $726 million (€493 million) under its
three year €650 million revolving credit facility. The
proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand of $116 million
were used to refinance $1,259 million of the $1,517 million of
SigmaKalon debt outstanding on the date of acquisition.
On March 18, 2008, PPG
completed a public offering of $600 million in aggregate principal
amount of its 5.75% Notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”),
$700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.65% Notes due
2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and $250 million in aggregate
principal amount of its 7.70% Notes due 2038 (the “2038
Notes” and, together with the 2013 Notes and the 2018 Notes,
the “Notes”). The Notes were offered by the Company
pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement. The proceeds
of this offering of $1,538 million (net of discount and issuance
costs) and additional borrowings of $195 million under the
€650 million revolving credit facility were used to
repay existing debt, including certain short-term debt and the
amounts outstanding under the €1 billion bridge loan. No
further amounts can be borrowed under the €1 billion bridge
loan. The discount and issuance costs related to the Notes, which
totaled $12 million, will be amortized to interest expense over the
respective lives of the Notes.

8. Financing Activities Accounts Receivable Sales Facility In May 2009, we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility for an additional one year period under terms similar to those previously in place. The renewed facility will expire in May 2010. The May 2009 renewal increased the committed balance from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion, although from time-to-time the available amount may be less than $1.1 billion based on concentration limits and receivable eligibility requirements. Through this facility, McKesson Corporation sells certain U.S. pharmaceutical trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary which then sells these receivables to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of McKesson Corporation that is consolidated in our financial statements. This SPE then sells undivided interests in the receivables to third-party purchaser groups, each of which includes commercial paper conduits (“Conduits”), which are special purpose legal entities administered by financial institutions. Sales of undivided interests in the receivables by the SPE to the Conduits are accounted for as a sale because we have relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, accounts receivable sold under these transactions are excluded from receivables, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Receivables sold and receivables retained by the Company are carried at face value, which due to the short-term nature of our accounts receivable and terms of the facility, approximates fair value. McKesson receives cash in the amount of the face value for the undivided interests in the receivables sold. No gain or loss is recorded upon sale as fee charges from the Conduits are based upon a floating yield rate and the period the undivided interests remain outstanding. Fee charges from the Conduits are accrued at the end of each month and are recorded within administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Should we default under the accounts receivable sales facility, the Conduits are entitled to receive only collections on receivables owned by the SPE. We continue servicing the receivables sold. No servicing asset is recorded at the time of sale because we do not receive any servicing fees from third parties or other income related to servicing the receivables. We do not record any servicing liability at the time of sale as the receivables collection period is relatively short and the costs of servicing the receivables sold over the servicing period are insignificant. Servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing period. Information regarding our outstanding balances related to our interests in accounts receivable sold or qualifying receivables retained is as follows: September 30, March 31, (In millions) 2009 2009 Receivables sold outstanding (1) $
— $
— Receivables retained, net of allowance for doubtful accounts 4,833 4,814 (1) Deducted from receivables, net in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The delinquency ratio for the qualifying receivables represented less than 1% of the total qualifying receivables as of September 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009. Revolving Credit Facility We have a syndicated $1.3 billion five-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in June 2012. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based upon either a Prime rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate. Total borrowings under this facility were nil and $189 million for the first six months of 2010 and 2009. As of September 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. Commercial Paper We issued and repaid commercial paper of nil and approximately $3.3 billion for the first six months of 2010 and 2009. There were no commercial paper issuances outstanding at September 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009. Long-Term Debt On February 12, 2009, we issued 6.50% notes due February 15, 2014 (the “2014 Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million and 7.50% notes due February 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on August 15, 2009. The 2014 Notes will mature on February 15, 2014 and the 2019 Notes will mature on February 15, 2019. We utilized net proceeds, after offering expenses, of $693 million from the issuance of the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes for general corporate purposes. "

11 DEBT In September 2008, our
Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0
billion. Our initial commercial paper program provided for the
issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion. Subsequent to the issuance
of our long-term debt in May 2009, we increased the commercial
paper program and, during the current quarter, issued an additional
$250 million of commercial paper. As of September 30, 2009, we
had $2.25 billion of commercial paper and $3.75 billion of
long-term debt issued and outstanding.
Short-term Debt As of September 30,
2009, our $2.25 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding
had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of
0.18% and maturities of 49 to 127 days. The estimated fair value of
this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. We also had two credit
facilities aggregating $3.0 billion with no amounts drawn against
them as of September 30, 2009. These facilities serve as a
back-up for our commercial paper program. Our $2.0 billion and $1.0
billion credit facilities expire on November 6, 2009 and
March 12, 2010, respectively. As of September 30, 2009,
we were in compliance with the financial covenant in both credit
agreements, which requires a coverage ratio maintained of at least
three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization to interest expense.
Long-term Debt As of September 30,
2009, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our
long-term debt were $3.75 billion and $3.81 billion, respectively.
The estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our
publicly-traded debt as of September 30, 2009.

(2) We have hedged $50 million principal amount of our $175 million 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011. The hedge provides for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments. Please see Note 7, “Derivative Financial Instruments – Interest Rate Swap.” Credit Arrangements We have a revolving credit facility that matures in June 2012 and provides for loan commitments of $1.25 billion from a syndicate of more than 15 financial institutions, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, as agent. As of September 30, 2009, the largest commitment was 16% of total commitments. However, the amount that we can borrow under the facility could be limited by changing expectations of future oil and natural gas prices because the amount that we can borrow under the facility is determined by our lenders annually each May (and may be r
edetermined at the option of our lenders in the case of certain acquisitions or divestitures) using a process that takes into account the value of our estimated reserves and hedge position and the lenders’ commodity price assumptions. In the future, total loan commitments under the facility could be increased to a maximum of $1.65 billion if the existing lenders increase their individual loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the facility. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from ti
me to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points or (b) a base Eurodollar rate substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (87.5 basis points per annum at September 30, 2009). We pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating (0.175% per annum a
t September 30, 2009). We incurred fees under this arrangement of approximately $0.3 million and $1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, which are recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, we incurred commitment fees of approximately $0.4 million and $1 million, respectively. Our credit facility has restrictive covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0; maintenance of a ratio of total debt to earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, ceiling test writedowns, and goodwill impairments) of at least 3.5 to 1.0. In addition, for as long as our debt rating is below investment grade, we must maintain a ratio of the calculated net present value of our oil and gas properties to total debt of at least 1.75 to 1.00. For purposes of this ratio, total debt includes only 50% of the principal amount of our senior subordinated notes. At September 30, 2009 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. As of September
160;30, 2009, we had $16 million of undrawn letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility. Letters of credit are subject to an issuance fee of 12.5 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt rating (87.5 basis points at September 30, 2009). Subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we also have a total of $120 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions, the availability of which is at the discr
etion of the financial institution. Our credit facility and senior and senior subordinated notes contain standard events of default and, if any such events of default were to occur, our lenders could terminate future lending commitments under the credit facility and our lenders could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable. In addition, our credit facility, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations.

billion of Senior Notes. In connection with this debt issuance,
Generation entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps in the
aggregate notional amount of approximately $1.1 billion. The
interest rate swaps were settled on September 16, 2009 with
Generation recording a pre-tax gain of approximately $7 million.
The gain was recorded to other comprehensive income within
Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be
amortized to income over the life of the related debt as a
reduction in interest expense.
On September 23, 2009, Exelon purchased pursuant to a cash
tender offer $387 million of its 6.75% Senior Notes due May 1,
2011 (Exelon Notes) and Generation purchased pursuant to a cash
tender offer for $555 million of its 6.95% Senior Notes due
June 15, 2011 (Generation Notes). The aggregate principal
amount of the Exelon Notes and Generation Notes tendered
represented approximately 77% and 79% of Exelon Notes and
Generation Notes outstanding, respectively. In connection with the
tender offer, Exelon and Generation incurred losses associated with
the early retirement of debt of approximately $36 million and $57
million, respectively, as a result of paying a price greater than
par value of the Exelon Notes and Generation Notes. The expense
related to the charges is included within other, net in Exelon and
Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income.
Additionally, Exelon called for redemption, on October 23,
2009, its remaining outstanding Exelon Notes and Generation called
for redemption, on October 23, 2009, its remaining outstanding
Generation Notes. In connection with the call, Exelon and
Generation incurred losses associated with the early retirement of
debt of approximately $10 million and $14 million, respectively,
which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Accordingly,
the remaining balances of outstanding Exelon Notes and Generation
Notes have been reclassified to current liabilities within Exelon
and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at
September 30, 2009. Variable
Rate Debt
As noted above, Generation repurchased $46 million in
unenhanced tax-exempt variable-rate debt on February 23, 2009
due to a failed remarketing. In June 2009, Generation refinanced
the debt with $46 million in bonds at a term rate through
May 2012 with a maturity of 2042.
During the second quarter of 2009, ComEd repurchased $191
million of its credit enhanced variable-rate tax-exempt debt. This
debt was then remarketed with credit enhancement provided by
letters of credit issued under ComEd’s unsecured revolving
credit facility. The letters of credit expire shortly before the
expiration of the credit facility in 2011.
Generation had letters of credit that expired during the third
quarter of 2009, which were used to credit enhance variable-rate
long-term tax-exempt debt totaling $307 million, with maturities
ranging from 2021 – 2034. Generation could not find
alternative letters of credit at reasonable terms, and therefore
repurchased the $307 million in tax-exempt debt during September
2009. Generation has the ability to remarket these bonds whenever
it determines it to be economically advantageous given market
conditions. In addition, Generation has letter of credit facilities
that will expire in the second quarter of 2010, which are used to
credit enhance variable-rate long-term tax-exempt debt totaling
$213 million, with maturities ranging from 2016 – 2034.
Generation intends to extend or replace the expiring letters of
credit with new letters of credit at reasonable terms, or remarket
the bonds with an interest rate term not requiring letter of credit
support. If Generation is unable to remarket these bonds at
reasonable terms Generation will repurchase them.
Under the terms of Generation’s and ComEd’s
variable-rate tax-exempt debt agreements, Generation or ComEd may
be required to repurchase any outstanding debt before its stated
maturity unless supported by sufficient letters of credit. If
either Generation or ComEd were required to repurchase the debt, it

Generation entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps in the
aggregate notional amount of approximately $1.1 billion. The
interest rate swaps were settled on September 16, 2009 with
Generation recording a pre-tax gain of approximately $7 million.
The gain was recorded to other comprehensive income within
Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be
amortized to income over the life of the related debt as a
reduction in interest expense.
On September 23, 2009, Exelon purchased pursuant to a cash
tender offer $387 million of its 6.75% Senior Notes due May 1,
2011 (Exelon Notes) and Generation purchased pursuant to a cash
tender offer for $555 million of its 6.95% Senior Notes due
June 15, 2011 (Generation Notes). The aggregate principal
amount of the Exelon Notes and Generation Notes tendered
represented approximately 77% and 79% of Exelon Notes and
Generation Notes outstanding, respectively. In connection with the
tender offer, Exelon and Generation incurred losses associated with
the early retirement of debt of approximately $36 million and $57
million, respectively, as a result of paying a price greater than
par value of the Exelon Notes and Generation Notes. The expense
related to the charges is included within other, net in Exelon and
Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income.
Additionally, Exelon called for redemption, on October 23,
2009, its remaining outstanding Exelon Notes and Generation called
for redemption, on October 23, 2009, its remaining outstanding
Generation Notes. In connection with the call, Exelon and
Generation incurred losses associated with the early retirement of
debt of approximately $10 million and $14 million, respectively,
which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Accordingly,
the remaining balances of outstanding Exelon Notes and Generation
Notes have been reclassified to current liabilities within Exelon
and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at
September 30, 2009. Variable
Rate Debt
As noted above, Generation repurchased $46 million in
unenhanced tax-exempt variable-rate debt on February 23, 2009
due to a failed remarketing. In June 2009, Generation refinanced
the debt with $46 million in bonds at a term rate through
May 2012 with a maturity of 2042.
During the second quarter of 2009, ComEd repurchased $191
million of its credit enhanced variable-rate tax-exempt debt. This
debt was then remarketed with credit enhancement provided by
letters of credit issued under ComEd’s unsecured revolving
credit facility. The letters of credit expire shortly before the
expiration of the credit facility in 2011.
Generation had letters of credit that expired during the third
quarter of 2009, which were used to credit enhance variable-rate
long-term tax-exempt debt totaling $307 million, with maturities
ranging from 2021 – 2034. Generation could not find
alternative letters of credit at reasonable terms, and therefore
repurchased the $307 million in tax-exempt debt during September
2009. Generation has the ability to remarket these bonds whenever
it determines it to be economically advantageous given market
conditions. In addition, Generation has letter of credit facilities
that will expire in the second quarter of 2010, which are used to
credit enhance variable-rate long-term tax-exempt debt totaling
$213 million, with maturities ranging from 2016 – 2034.
Generation intends to extend or replace the expiring letters of
credit with new letters of credit at reasonable terms, or remarket
the bonds with an interest rate term not requiring letter of credit
support. If Generation is unable to remarket these bonds at
reasonable terms Generation will repurchase them.
Under the terms of Generation’s and ComEd’s
variable-rate tax-exempt debt agreements, Generation or ComEd may
be required to repurchase any outstanding debt before its stated
maturity unless supported by sufficient letters of credit. If
either Generation or ComEd were required to repurchase the debt, it
would reassess its options to obtain new letters of credit or
remarket the bonds in a manner that does not require letter of
credit support. Generation and ComEd have classified amounts
outstanding under these debt agreements as long-term based on
management’s intent and ability to either renew or replace

These credit facilities consist of a $700 million revol
ving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""), as well as a 58 million euro credit facility (""Euro Facility""). The Credit Facility has two tranches, with $125 million expiring in 2012 and $575 million expiring in 2013. The Euro Facility expires in 2012. Borrowings under these credit facilities are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. The Credit Facility requires a facility fee on the total commitment. In addition, these credit facilities contain a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At September 30, 2009, the Company's credit facility borrowings totaled $85 million at an effective interest rate of 0.79 percent. At December 31, 2008, the Company's credit facility borrow
ings totaled $84 million at an effective interest rate of 3.74 percent. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Given the expiration dates of the Credit Facility, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long-term borrowings because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such borrowings on a long-term basis.

;#160; $ 2,877,734 $ 3,078,089 June 2009 Debt Tender On May 19, 2009, the Company commenced a cash tender offer to purchase up to $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% Senior Notes due 2010 and 7.50% Senior Notes due 2011 (collectively, the “Notes”). On June 16, 2009, the Company finalized its cash tender offer (the “June 2009 Debt Tender”) by purchasing approximately $174 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% Senior Notes Due 2010 and approximately $26 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2011 that resulted in pre-tax losses of $4.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The aggregate pre-tax loss of $6.3 million includes the write-off of $0.5 million of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts and cash payments of $5.8 million related to premiums and other costs to purchase the Notes and is included in “other income (expen
se), net.” The June 2009 Debt Tender was financed with cash on-hand and $150 million of borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility. Secured Receivables Credit Facility For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the Company borrowed $510 million under its Secured Receivables Credit Facility primarily to fund second quarter payments totaling $308 million in connection with the previously disclosed settlement of the federal government investigation related to NID (see Note 9) and to fund $150 million of debt repayments in connection with the June 2009 Debt Tender. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the Company repaid $410 million on its Secured Receivables Credit Facility. At September 30, 2009, borrowings outstanding under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility totaled $100 million. As of September 30, 2009, long-term debt maturing in each of the years ending subsequent to September 30, 2010 is as follows: Fiscal Year ending December 31, 2010 $ 226,795 2011 782,640 2012 561,933 2013 1,222 2014 640 2015 499,306 Thereafter 805,198 Total long-term debt $ 2,877,734 A full description of the terms of the Company’s indebtedness and related debt service requirements is contained in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K."

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt For a more detailed description of Hospiras short-term
borrowings and long-term debt, see Note 10 to Hospiras
consolidated financial statements included in Hospiras Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2008. In January 2009, the remaining $5.0 million in
principal outstanding as of December 31, 2008, under the
$500.0 million three-year term loan facility due
March 2010, was paid. Beginning in March 2009, the $375.0
million principal amount of floating rate notes are classified as
short-term borrowings as they mature in March 2010.
In May 2009, Hospira
issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.40% notes
which are due May 15, 2015, with interest due semi-annually,
for general corporate purposes. This issuance contains covenants
consistent with other existing borrowings. In June 2009,
Hospira repaid in full the $300.0 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.95% notes upon maturity. In late July and early August 2009, Hospira
entered into interest rate swap contracts whereby $200.0 million of
the $400.0 million five-year senior unsecured notes due
June 2014 and $100.0 million of the $250.0 million senior
unsecured notes due May 2015 were effectively converted from
fixed to floating rate debt. As of September 30, 2009, Hospira had a five-year
$375.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in
December 2010 with no amounts outstanding. Certain borrowing agreements contain covenants that
require compliance with, among other restrictions, a maximum
leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of
September 30, 2009, Hospira was in compliance with all
applicable covenants. On October 14, 2009, Hospira entered into a new
$700.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver)
maturing in October 2012. The Revolver replaced Hospiras
prior revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in
December 2010. The Revolver is available for general corporate
purposes. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at LIBOR or a
base rate plus, in each case, a margin. Hospira also pays a
facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments under the
Revolver. The annual percentage rates for the LIBOR margin, the
base rate margin and the facility fee are 2.5%, 1.5% and 0.5%,
respectively, and are subject to increase or decrease if there is a
change in Hospiras credit ratings. The amount of available
borrowings may be increased to a maximum of $825.0 million,
under certain circumstances. The Revolver also contains financial
covenants consistent with Hospiras prior revolving credit
agreement that require Hospira to maintain a maximum leverage ratio
and minimum interest coverage ratio. "

3,064 Issuance of Senior
Convertible Notes On May 4, 2009, U.
S. Steel issued $863 million of 4.00% Senior Convertible Notes (the
“2014 Senior Convertible Notes”) due May 15, 2014.
U. S. Steel received net proceeds from the offering of $836 million
after fees of $27 million related to the underwriting discount and
third party expenses. The fees for the issuance of the 2014 Senior
Convertible Notes will be amortized to interest expense over their
five-year term. The 2014 Senior
Convertible Notes are senior and unsecured obligations that rank
equally with U. S. Steel’s other existing and future
senior and unsecured indebtedness. Interest on the 2014 Senior
Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually on
May 15th
and
November 15th
of each year, beginning
on November 15, 2009. If an event of default regarding the
2014 Senior Convertible Notes should occur and be continuing,
either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in the
principal amount of outstanding 2014 Senior Convertible Notes may
declare the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes immediately due and
payable. The 2014 Senior Convertible Notes were issued under U. S.
Steel’s shelf registration statement and are not listed on
any national securities exchange. U. S. Steel may not
redeem the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes prior to their maturity
date. Holders may convert their 2014 Senior Convertible Notes into
shares of U. S. Steel common stock at their option at any time
prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day
immediately preceding the maturity date of May 15, 2014. The
initial conversion rate for the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes is
31.3725 shares of U. S. Steel common stock per $1,000 principal
amount of 2014 Senior Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial
conversion price of approximately $31.875 per share of common
stock, subject to adjustment as defined in the 2014 Senior
Convertible Notes. On the issuance date of the 2014 Senior
Convertible Notes, the market price of
U. S. Steel’s common stock was below the stated
conversion price of $31.875 and therefore, there was no beneficial
conversion option to the holders. Based on the initial conversion
rate, the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes are convertible into
27,058,781 shares of U. S. Steel common stock. However, we reserved
33,824,000 shares, which is the maximum amount that could be issued
upon conversion. Other than receiving cash in lieu of fractional
shares, holders do not have the option to receive cash upon
conversion. If U. S. Steel undergoes
a fundamental change, as defined in the 2014 Senior Convertible
Notes, holders may require us to repurchase the 2014 Senior
Convertible Notes in whole or in part for cash at a price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the 2014 Senior Convertible Notes
to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including
additional interest, if any) up to, but excluding the repurchase
date. The 2014 Senior
Convertible Notes restrict our ability to create certain liens, to
enter into sale leaseback transactions, and to consolidate, merge
or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets. Repayment of Term
Loans U. S. Steel used $655
million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Senior
Convertible Notes and the issuance of common stock (see Note 13) to
repay all amounts outstanding under its three-year Term Loan due
October 2010 and five-year Term Loan due May 2012. The remaining
net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Amended Credit
Agreement On June 12, 2009, U.
S. Steel entered into an amendment and restatement of its $750
million Credit Agreement dated May 11, 2007 (Amended Credit
Agreement) which revised pricing and amended other customary terms
and conditions. U. S. Steel simultaneously entered into a security
agreement providing for a security interest in the majority of its
domestic inventory, certain accounts receivable and related
collateral. The Amended Credit
Agreement established a borrowing base formula, which limits the
amounts U. S. Steel can borrow to a certain percent of the value of
certain domestic inventory less specified reserves, and eliminates
the previous financial covenants that consisted of an interest
coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. The Amended Credit Agreement
contains a new financial covenant requiring U. S. Steel to maintain
a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit
Agreement) of at least 1.10 to 1.00 for the most recent four
consecutive quarters when availability under the Amended Credit
Agreement is less than the greater of 15% of the total aggregate
commitments and $112.5 million. As of September 30,
2009, there were no amounts drawn on the Amended Credit Agreement
and inventory levels supported the full $750 million of the
facility. Since availability was greater than $112.5 million,
compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant was not
applicable. However, based on the most recent four quarters, as of
September 30, 2009, we would not meet this covenant if we were
to borrow more than $637.5 million. If current economic conditions
continue, the value or levels of inventory may decrease or we may
not be able to meet this covenant in the future. Either or both of
those situations would affect our ability to borrow the full amount
of this facility. Other
obligations At September 30,
2009, in the event of a change in control of U. S. Steel,
debt obligations totaling $2,463 million, plus any sums then
outstanding under our $750 million Credit Facility may be declared
immediately due and payable. In such event, U. S. Steel
may also be required to either repurchase the leased Fairfield slab
caster for $46 million or provide a letter of credit to secure the
remaining obligation. In the event of the
bankruptcy of Marathon Oil Corporation (Marathon), $484 million of
obligations related to Environmental Revenue Bonds, the Fairfield
Caster Lease and the coke battery lease at the Clairton Plant may
be declared immediately due and payable. U. S. Steel
Košice (USSK) credit facilities At September 30,
2009, USSK had €200 million (approximately $293 million)
borrowed against its three-year revolving unsecured credit
facility. At September 30,
2009, USSK had no borrowings against its €40 million and €20 million credit facilities (which
approximated $88 million), but had $8 million of customs and other
guarantees outstanding, reducing availability to $80 million. On
October 8, 2009, USSK entered into a new €
40 million three-year revolving unsecured credit facility that
expires in October of 2012. This facility replaced the existing
€40 million facility that was to expire in
December 2009. The new facility provides for revised pricing but is
otherwise substantially similar to the one it replaced. The
€
20 million credit facility expires in December 2009 and we are
currently negotiating a new agreement. U. S. Steel Serbia
(USSS) credit facility During the third quarter
of 2009, USSS amended its €50 million (approximately $73 million)
secured working capital facility agreements. Availability is now
limited to the value of USSS’s inventory of finished and
semi-finished goods. Interest on borrowings is based on a spread
over LIBOR or other defined European bank rates. The agreements
contain customary terms and conditions and expire on
August 31, 2010. At September 30, 2009, there were no
borrowings against this facility and availability was €35 million ($52 million). "

459.6 (a) In 2006, the Company entered into several interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting $325.0 million of fixed rate notes to variable rates. The weighted average effective interest rate of these borrowings, including the effects of outstanding swaps as noted in Note 10 was 5.3% as of December 31, 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, $100 million in interest rate swaps related to the Company’s 2009 fixed rate debt matured and the Company terminated $150 million in interest rate swap agreements related to the Company’s 2016 fixed rate debt and $75 million of interest rate swap agreements related to the Company’s 2019 fixed rate debt. As a result of the first quarter 2009 swap terminations, a $34.5 million gain remained in debt to be amortized over the remaining lives of the respective 2016 and 2019 debt. As of September 30, 2009, the unamortized portion was $32.3 million. The Company’s multi-currency revolving credit facility provided for borrowings up to $600 million through July 22, 2009. On April 30, 2009, the Company extended its revolving credit facility for eighteen months, maturing January 22, 2011. The facility was reduced to $250 million beginning July 23, 2009. The facility is now secured by unperfected pledges of the Company’s equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain assets. No secured party is entitled to perfect its lien on any of the collateral until the long term unsecured senior, non-credit enhanced debt rating of the Company is less than or equal to BB+ by Standard & Poor’s and less than or equal to Ba1 by Moody’s. The Company’s credit rating as of September 30, 2009 was BBB by Standard & Poor’s and Ba1 by Moody’s. The three key covenants of the credit agreement are a net worth test, a debt compared to EBITDA (“Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”) test, and an interest coverage test. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2009 and expects to remain compliant in future periods. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. The Company had outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 of $15.2 million and $21.4 million, respectively. The letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions. The Company’s 6.50% Senior Notes of $136.7 million matured on February 17, 2009. On April 9, 2009, the Company issued $373.8 million in convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012. Under Topic 470, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), the Company must account for the convertible senior notes by bifurcating the instrument between their liability and equity components. The value of the debt component is based on the fair value of issuing a similar nonconvertible debt security. The equity component of the convertible debt security is calculated by deducting the value of the liability from the proceeds received at issuance. Therefore, the Company’s September 30, 2009 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an increase in debt of $325.9 million and an increase in capital in excess of par of $36.5 million. Additionally, Topic 470 requires us to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face value over the term of the notes. The Company’s interest expense associated with this bond accretion is based on the effective interest rate of the convertible senior notes of 9.365%. The total interest expense related to the convertible notes in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $7.1 million and $14.5 million, respectively. The non-cash portion of interest expense for the convertible notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $4.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively. For the full year of 2009, interest expense related to the convertible notes will be approximately $22.2 million, of which approximately $12.7 million will be non-cash. The notes will pay interest semi-annually of $6.5 million, which is at a coupon rate of 3.50% per year, beginning in October of this year. Holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 30.4706 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (representing an initial conversion price of approximately $32.82 per share of common stock). The conversion price represents a conversion premium of 27.50% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 2009, of $25.74 per share. As of September 30, 2009, the Company’s stock price was below the conversion price of $32.82. There was no dilutive impact to weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 due to the convertible senior notes. In conjunction with the note offering, the Company entered into a bond hedge overlay at a net pre-tax cost of $25.2 million, effectively raising the conversion premium to 50.0%, or approximately $38.61 per share. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our election. The convertible senior notes were issued under the Company’s $750 million universal shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, leaving approximately $376 million available as of September 30, 2009. As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the estimated fair values of the Company’s senior unsecured notes totaled $790.4 million and $532.3 million, respectively. The estimated fair values were $62.1 million higher at September 30, 2009 and $6.7 million lower at December 31, 2008 than their respective carrying values. Fair market values are developed by the use of estimates obtained from brokers and other appropriate valuation techniques based on information available as of quarter-end and year-end. The fair value estimates do not necessarily reflect the values the Company could realize in the current markets. "

On October 9, 2009, CERC amended its receivables facility to extend the termination date to October 8, 2010. Availability under CERC’s 364-day receivables facility now ranges from $150 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances. As of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, the facility siz
e was $128 million and $150 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, advances under the receivables facilities were $78 million and $40 million, respectively. Inventory Financing. In December 2008, CERC entered into an asset management agreement whereby it sold $110 million of its natural gas in storage and agreed to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas during the 2008-2009 winter heating season for payments totaling $114 million. This transaction was accounted for as a financing and, as of December
0;31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, CenterPoint Energy’s financial statements reflect natural gas inventory of $75 million and $-0-, respectively, and a financing obligation of $75 million and $-0-, respectively, related to this transaction. Revolving Credit Facility. On October 6, 2009, CenterPoint Houston terminated its $600 million 364-day credit facility which was secured by a pledge of $600 million of general mortgage bonds issued by CenterPoint Houston. From inception through its termination, there had been no borrowings under the credit facility. (b) Long-term Debt General Mortgage Bonds. In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds, due in March 2014 with an interest rate of 7.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowi
ngs under its revolving credit facility and the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Ike. Revolving Credit Facilities. CenterPoint Energy’s $1.2 billion credit facility has a first drawn cost of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 55 basis points based on CenterPoint Energy’s current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and other securitization bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant, which was modified (i) in August 2008 so that the permitted ratio of debt to EBITDA would continue at its then-current level for the remaining term of the facility and (ii) in November 2008 so that the permitted ratio of debt to EBITDA would be temporarily increased until the earlier of December 31, 2009 or CenterPoint Houston’s issuance of bonds to securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike, after which time the permitted ratio would revert to the level that existed prior to the November 2008 modification. Non-recourse securitization bonds are not included within the definition of debt for purposes of this covenant. CenterPoint Houston’s $289 million credit facility contains a debt (excluding transition and oth
er securitization bonds) to total capitalization covenant. The facility’s first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston’s current credit ratings. On October 7, 2009, the size of the CERC Corp. revolving credit facility was reduced from $950 million to $915 million through removal of Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (Lehman) as a lender. Prior to its removal, Lehman had a $35 million commitment to lend. All credit facility loans to CERC Corp. that were funded by Lehman were repaid in September 2009. CERC Corp.’s $915 million credit facility’s first dr
awn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp.’s current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt to total capitalization covenant. Under CenterPoint Energy’s $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston’s $289 million credit facility and CERC Corp.’s $915 million credit facility, an additional utilization fee of 5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the utilization fee fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating. As of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, the following loan balances were outstanding under CenterPoint Energy’s long-term revolving credit facilities (in millions): December 31, 2008 September 30, 2009 CenterPoint Energy credit facility borrowings $ 264 $ - CenterPoint Houston credit facility borrowings 251 - CERC Corp. credit facility borrowings 926 160; 10 Total credit facility borrowings td> $ 1,441 $ 10 In addition, as of both December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, CenterPoint Energy had approximately $27 million of outstanding letters of credit under its $1.2 billion credit facility and CenterPoint Houston had approximately $4 million of outstanding letters of credit under its $289 million credit facility. There was no commercial paper outstanding that would have been backstopped by CenterPoint Energy’s $1.2 billion credit facility as of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009. There was $-0- and $15 million of outstanding commercial paper backstopped by CERC Corp.’s credit facility as of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively. CenterPoint Energy

Convertible Debt Securities On January 1, 2009, new accounting guidance became effective relating to our 3.25% Notes. Upon adoption on the effective date, the new accounting guidance was retroactively applied, as re

This resulted in $4.8 million and $13.9 million of additional non-cash interest expense recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, and $2.9 million of additional non-cash interest expense recorded for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008.

The 2012 senior notes, when issued in November 2007, were priced at 99.911% with a yield of 5.399%. Interest payments are required to be made semiannually on February 15 and August 15.

The 2037 senior notes, when issued in November 2007, were priced at 99.605% with a yield of 6.580%. Interest payments are required to be made semiannually on May 15 and November 15. Available Financing The size of our total commercial paper program remains $1.2 billion and is supported by the revolving credit agreements described below. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2009. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008 totaled $70.0 million, with an average interest rate and average term of 1.4% and 29 days. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2008 totaled $307.1 million, with an average interest rate and average term of 2.5% and 9 days. These total borrowings are classified as current notes payable in the consolidated balance sheet. On September 12, 2008 we closed on a revolving credit facility agreement totaling $1.15 billion collectively (the “credit facility”) to replace the previous $1.2 billion five-year credit facility that was to expire on July 20, 2009. The $1.15 billion credit facility consisted of two separate tranches, a $383.3 million 364-day facility and a $766.7 million 3-year facility. A syndicate of fourteen banks led by JP Morgan and Bank of America participated in the credit facility. The previous credit facility was cancelled after the new credit facility became effective. On August 14, 2009 we entered into a new $433.3 million 364-day revolving credit facility (the “new 364-day facility”) which replaces our existing $383.3 million 364-day credit agreement entered into on September 12, 2008. The previous credit facility was cancelled after the new 364-day facility became effective. The combined credit facility now totals $1.2 billion and consists of two separate tranches, a $433.3 million 364-day facility that will terminate on August 13, 2010 and a $766.7 million 3-year facility that will terminate on September 12, 2011. We pay a commitment fee of 12.5-37.5 basis points for the new 364-day facility and a commitment fee of 10-20 basis points for the 3-year facility, depending upon our credit rating, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. At our current credit rating, the commitment fee is 12.5 basis points for the new 364-day facility and 10 basis points for the 3-year facility. The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (i) a spread over the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) that is based on our credit rating (“LIBOR loans”) or (ii) on the higher of (a) the prime rate, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent (b) 0.5% plus the Federal funds rate, or (c) LIBOR plus 1% (“ABR loans”). The interest rate spread on LIBOR loans is calculated by multiplying the current 30 business day average of the CDX 5-year investment grade index by a percentage, ranging from 75-150% for the new 364-day facility and from 50-100% for the 3-year facility. At our current credit rating, the borrowing rate would be 75% of this index on the new 364-day facility and 50% on the 3-year facility, with a minimum spread of 0.75% on the new 364-day facility and 0.5% on the 3-year facility. We have the option at the termination of the new 364-day facility to convert any revolving loans outstanding into term loans for an additional year. Term loans can be LIBOR loans or ABR loans and would carry an additional spread of 1.0%. The credit facilities contain certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that we not exceed indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in the credit facilities, of 4 to 1. This covenant is similar to the previous credit agreements and has never been exceeded. There were no borrowings under either of the facilities as of September 30, 2009, December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2008. We have the capacity to issue Extendible Commercial Notes (“ECNs”) of up to $240 million, provided that sufficient investor demand for ECNs exists. ECNs replicate commercial paper, except that we have an option to extend the note beyond its initial redemption date to a maximum final maturity of 390 days. However, if exercised, such an extension is at a higher reset rate, which is at a predetermined spread over LIBOR and is related to our commercial paper rating at the time of extension. As a result of the extension option, no backup facilities for these borrowings are required. As is the case with commercial paper, ECNs have no financial covenants. There were no ECN borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2009, December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2008. In the current credit environment, the ECN market is not available and we have no plans to utilize this market. On April 19, 2007, we signed a promissory note with one of our providers of banking services to enable us to borrow additional funds, on an uncommitted basis, from time to time to supplement our commercial paper and ECN borrowings. The specific terms (principal, interest rate and maturity date) of each borrowing governed by this promissory note are determined on the borrowing date of each loan. These borrowings have no financial covenants. There were no promissory note borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2009, December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2008. In the current credit environment, the market for these instruments is currently not available and we have no plans to utilize them in the short-term. On January 1, 2009, we transferred most of Standard & Poor’s U.S. properties and assets from a division to a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary (“S&P subsidiary”). This reorganization was initiated to address future operational and financial conditions, and will not affect the ongoing conduct of Standard & Poor’s businesses, including the credit ratings business. In conjunction with this reorganization, a series of supplemental agreements were executed. They include a supplemental indenture for our $1.2 billion senior notes (three tranches of $400 million due in 2012, 2017 and 2037), amendments to our $1.15 billion credit agreement entered into on September 12, 2008, amendments to the commercial paper issuing and paying agency agreement (with JP Morgan Chase) and amended and restated commercial paper dealer agreements (with JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America/Merrill Lynch). All of these agreements and amendments provide that the new S&P subsidiary will guarantee the senior notes issued pursuant to the indenture, amounts borrowed under the credit agreement and the commercial paper. Long-term debt was $1,197.7 million, $1,197.6 million and $1,197.6 million as of September 30, 2009, December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2008, respectively. The carrying amount of our borrowings approximates fair value at September 30, 2009. We paid interest on its debt totaling $10.7 million and $12.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $46.5 million and $46.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the third quarter of 2008, cash was utilized to repurchase approximately 3.1 million shares for $129.3 million on a settlement date basis. An additional 0.4 million shares were repurchased in the third quarter of 2008, which settled in October 2008. Accordingly, we recorded a liability of $13.1 million, classified in other current liabilities at September 30, 2008. "

1,340.3 At September 30, 2009, our credit facility includes $720.0 million of Term A loans, $800.0 million of Term-1 loans and a $600.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility (none of which was outstanding as of September 30, 2009) is available for general corporate purposes. During the first nine months of 2009, we made scheduled payments of $240.0 million on the Term A loan. While we cannot provide any assurances that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to make our scheduled payments, we anticipate that we will continue making scheduled payments under the terms of the credit agreement until the loan is repaid in full on or before the maturity date of October 14, 2010. We do not believe we will need to secure external sources of capital in order to meet these obligations; however, we may decide to secure external capital for operating activities or for other business needs. In the event future cash flows are insufficient to meet our scheduled payments, we believe it will be possible to amend, extend, and/or refinance the Term loans prior to their maturity. The credit facility requires us to pay interest periodically on the London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) or base rate options, plus a margin. The margin over LIBOR will range from 0.50% to 1.125%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or our credit rating. Under the credit facility we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the $600.0 million revolving credit facility. The commitment fee will range from 0.10% to 0.25% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or our credit rating. At September 30, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on the facility was 1.4%. The credit facility contains covenants which limit the indebtedness we may incur, the common shares we may repurchase, and dividends we may pay. The repurchase and dividend covenant applies if certain leverage thresholds are exceeded. The covenants also include a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. At September 30, 2009, we believe we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants associated with our credit facility. On June 9, 2009, we issued $2.5 billion of Senior Notes, including $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Notes due 2012; $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Senior Notes due 2014 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.250% Senior Notes due 2019. The Senior Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. We may redeem some or all of each series of Senior Notes prior to maturity at a price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of any notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest; or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes being redeemed, not including unpaid interest accrued to the redemption date, discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the treasury rate plus 50 basis points with respect to any 2012 notes, 2014 notes and 2019 notes being redeemed, plus in each case, unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed accrued to the redemption date. In addition, if the Acquisition Agreement is terminated for any reason we will be required to redeem the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the stated principal amount, plus unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Senior Notes are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by most of our current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. Financing costs of $13.3 million, for the issuance of the Senior Notes, are being amortized over an average weighted period of 5.2 years and are reflected in other intangible assets, net in the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet. We intend to use the net proceeds for the acquisition of WellPoint’s NextRx PBM Business (see Note 3). We entered into a commitment letter with a syndicate of commercial banks for an unsecured, 364-day, $2.5 billion term loan credit facility in order to finance the NextRx acquisition. Upon completion of the public offering of common stock and debt securities, we terminated the credit facility and incurred $56.3 million in fees. "

We hereinafter refer to these credit facilities collectively as our Credit Facilities. At both September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit. We had outstanding letters of credit of $114.3 million and $104.2 million at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, which reduced borrowing capacity to $285.7 million and $295.8 million, respectively. The carrying amount of our term loan approximated fair value at September 30, 2009. The interbank market for our term loan implied a fair value of approximately $495 million at December 31, 2008, as compared with a carrying value of $549.7 million. Borrowings under our Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the base rate (which is based on the greater of the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under our Credit Facilities or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%) or (2) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), which as of September 30, 2009 was 0.875% and 1.50% for borrowings under our revolving line of credit and term loan, respectively. We may prepay loans under our Credit Facilities in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, we made scheduled repayments under our Credit Facilities of $1.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively. We have scheduled repayments under our Credit Facilities of $1.4 million due in each of the next four quarters. European Letter of Credit Facility As previously disclosed, our 364-day unsecured European Letter of Credit Facility (“European rLOC Facility”), which has a commitment of €110.0 million, was extended beyond its September 11, 2009 expiration date through November 9, 2009. The European LOC Facility is used for contingent obligations solely in respect of surety and performance bonds, bank guarantees and similar obligations. We had outstanding letters of credit drawn on the European LOC Facility of €81.7 million ($119.6 million) and €104.0 million ($145.2 million) as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. We pay certain fees for the letters of credit written against the European LOC Facility based upon the ratio of our total debt to consolidated EBITDA. As of September 30, 2009, the annual fees equaled 0.875% plus a fronting fee of 0.1%. "

Borrowings As
of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, our
long-term borrowings, net of unamortized discounts and other,
consisted of the following: September 30,
2009 December 31,
2008 (Dollars in millions) Current portion of long-term
borrowings: Long-term notes $ 903 $ 792 Long-term capital lease and other

obligations 97 62 Total long-term borrowingsnet 13,210 12,735 Total long-term borrowingsnet, including current
portion $ 14,135 $ 13,555 We
were in compliance with all provisions and covenants of our
borrowings as of September 30, 2009. Effective
January 1, 2009, we adopted FSP APB 14-1 (ASC 470). This
FSP requires issuers of convertible debt that may be settled fully
or partially in cash upon conversion to account separately for the
liability and equity components of the convertible debt. The
carrying amount of the equity component of our 3.50% Convertible
Senior Notes was $164 million as of September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008. At September 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the liability component of these notes had
a principal amount of $1.265 billion at both dates; an
unamortized discount value of $64 million and
$104 million, respectively; and a net carrying amount of
$1.201 billion and $1.161 billion, respectively. The
remaining discount will be amortized over the next 13 months.
The effective interest rate on our 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes
is 8.77%. The interest expense, inclusive of the 3.50% coupon and
amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs, recognized
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 was
$26 million and $77 million, respectively. The interest
expense, inclusive of the 3.50% coupon and amortization of the
discount and debt issuance costs, recognized for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2008 was $25 million and
$73 million, respectively. The
holders of our 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes have the option to
require us to repurchase their notes for cash every five years on
November 15, beginning in 2010, and receive cash from us equal
to the par value of the notes. We believe that, if the trading
price of our common stock is below the conversion price on
November 15, 2010, the likelihood of holders requiring us to
repurchase their notes will increase the more the conversion price
exceeds the trading price of our common stock. The conversion value
of the notes as of September 30, 2009 was calculated by using
the current conversion rate of 195.3085 per $1,000 in principal
amount of the notes or a conversion price of $5.12, adjusted for
certain events, including the payment of dividends, as described in
the indenture governing the notes. Repayment On
August 3, 2009, our wholly owned subsidiary, Qwest Capital
Funding, Inc (""QCF""), paid at maturity $562 million aggregate
principal amount of its 7.0% Notes due 2009. On
January 2, 2009, we redeemed $230 million aggregate
principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due
2009.
New
Issuance In
September 2009, we issued $550 million of 8.00% Senior Notes
due 2015. We are using the net proceeds of $532 million for
general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness and
funding and refinancing investments in our telecommunication
assets. In
April 2009, our wholly owned subsidiary, Qwest Corporation (""QC""),
issued approximately $811 million of 8.375% Senior Notes due
2016. QC is using the net proceeds of $738 million for general
corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness and funding
and refinancing investments in its telecommunication
assets.
Credit
Facility In
April 2009, in connection with the addition of a new lender to our
revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""), the amount
available to us under the Credit Facility increased from
$850 million to $910 million. In July 2009, in connection
with a $35 million increase in commitment by an existing
lender to the Credit Facility, the amount available to us under the
Credit Facility increased from $910 million to
$945 million. The Credit Facility is currently undrawn and
expires in October 2010. Any amounts drawn on the Credit Facility
are guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiary, Qwest Services
Corporation (""QSC""), and are secured by a senior lien on the stock
of
QC.

3,434 At both September 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, there were $321 million
outstanding of 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due
June 1, 2023. On June 1, 2010, holders may require
Schlumberger to repurchase their Series B debentures for cash.
Accordingly, these debentures are classified within Current
Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
September 30, 2009. The fair value of these Series B
debentures at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008
was $510 million and $398 million, respectively. For further
information regarding the debentures refer to Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in the
Schlumberger Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2008.
The fair value adjustment
presented above represents changes in the fair value of the portion
of Schlumberger’s fixed rate debt that is hedged through the
use of interest rate swaps.
During the third quarter of
2009, Schlumberger issued $450 million of 3.00% Guaranteed Notes
due 2013.
During the first quarter of
2009, Schlumberger entered into a €3.0 billion Euro Medium
Term Note program. This program provides for the issuance of
various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate
notes in Euro, US dollar or other currencies. Schlumberger issued
€1.0 billion 4.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2014 in the first
quarter of 2009 under this program. Schlumberger entered into
agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date of
issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar
denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US
dollars at a rate of 4.95%.
The fair value of
Schlumberger’s fixed rate long-term debt was estimated based
on quoted market prices.

llion credit-linked revolving facility terminating in 2014. Borrowings under the senior credit agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR (for US dollars) or EURIBOR (for Euros), as applicable, or, for US dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the term loans and any loans under the credit-linked revolving facility is 1.75%, subject to potential reductions as defined in the senior credit agreement. As of September 30, 2009 the applicable margin was 1.75%. The term loans under the senior credit agreement are subject to amortization at 1% of the initial principal amount per annum, payable quarterly. The remaining principal amount of the term loans is due on April 2, 2014. As of September 30, 2009, there were $92 million of letters of credit issued under the credit-linked revolving facility and $136 million remained available for borrowing. As of September 30, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. On June 30, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to the senior credit agreement. The amendment reduced the amount available under the revolving credit portion of the senior credit agreement from $650 million to $600 million and increased the first lien senior secured leverage ratio covenant that is applicable when any amount is outstanding under the revolving credit portion of the senior credit agreement as set forth below. Prior to giving effect to the amendment, the maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio was 3.90 to 1.00. As amended, the maximum senior secured leverage ratio for the following trailing four-quarter periods is as follows: First Lien Senior Secured Leverage Ratio September 30, 2009............................................................................................................................................................... 5.75 to 1.00 December 31, 2009................................................................................................................................................................ 5.25 to 1.00 March 31, 2010...................................................................................................................................................................... 4.75 to 1.00 June 30, 2010.................

Further, the Company’s first l
ien senior secured leverage ratio must be maintained at or below that threshold while any amounts are outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The first lien senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated first lien senior secured debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to adjustments identified in the credit agreement. Based on the estimated first lien senior secured leverage ratio for the trai
ling four quarters at September 30, 2009, the Company’s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility is $600 million. As of September 30, 2009, the Company estimates its first lien senior secured leverage ratio to be 4.37 to 1.00 (which would be 5.27 to 1.00 were the revolving credit facility fully drawn). The maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio under the revolving credit facility for such period is 5.75 to 1.00. The Company’s senior credit agreement also contains a number of restrictions on certain of its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, restrictions on their ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; merge, consolidate or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make investments; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions or hedge transactions; or engage in other businesses. The senior credit agreement also contains a number of affirmative covenants and events of default, including a cross-default to other debt of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries in an aggregate amount equal to more than $40 million and the occurrence of a change of control. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the repayment of loans and other financial obligations under the Company’s senior credit ag
reement. The senior credit agreement is guaranteed by Celanese Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Celanese Corporation, and certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company’s subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC (“Celanese US”), a Delaware limited liability company, and is secured by a lien on substantially all assets of Celanese US and such guarantors, subject to certain agreed exceptions, pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated as of April 2, 2007, by and among Celanese Holdings LLC, Celanese US, certain subsidiaries of Celanese US and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as Administrative Agent and as Collateral Agent. The Company is in compliance with all of the covenants related to its debt agreements as of September 30, 2009. "

Credit Facilities We have senior credit facilities with a syndicate of lenders that provided for committed senior secured financing in the aggregate amount of $2,300.0, consisting of the following: · a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 (balance of $637.4 at September 26, 2009) with a final maturity of September 2012; · a domestic revolving credit facility, available for loans and letters of credit, in an aggregate principal amount up to $400.0 with a final maturity of September 2012; · a global revolving credit facility, available for loans in Euros, British Pounds and other currencies in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $200.0 with a final maturity of September 2012; and · a foreign credit instrument facility, available for performance letters of credit and guarantees, in an aggregate principal amount in various currencies up to the equivalent of $950.0 with a final maturity of September 2012. Our senior credit facilities require that we maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (generally defined as the ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four fiscal quarters ended on such date to consolidated interest expense for such period) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of at least 3.50 to 1.00, and a Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of no more than 3.25 to 1.00. Our senior credit facilities also contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, loans, guarantees or advances, make restricted junior payments, including dividends, redemptions of capital stock and voluntary prepayments or repurchases of certain other indebtedness, engage in mergers, acquisitions or sales of assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. We do not expect these covenants to restrict our liquidity, financial condition or access to capital resources in the foreseeable future. Lastly, our senior credit facilities contain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. We are permitted under our senior credit facilities to repurchase our capital stock and pay cash dividends in an unlimited amount if our gross Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 2.50 to 1.00. If our gross Consolidated Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00, the aggregate amount of such repurchases and dividend declarations cannot exceed (A) $100.0 in any fiscal year plus (B) an additional amount for all such repurchases and dividend declarations made after September 21, 2007 equal to the sum of (i) $300.0 and (ii) a positive amount equal to 50% of cumulative consolidated net income during the period from July 1, 2007 to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial information is available preceding the date of such repurchase or dividend declaration (or, in case such consolidated net income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit). The weighted-average interest rate of our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities was approximately 4.38% for the nine months ended September 26, 2009, inclusive of the impact of interest rate protection agreements (Swaps). At September 26, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenant provisions of our senior credit facilities and did not have any restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends. Senior Notes In December 2007, we issued, in a private placement, $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior unsecured notes that mature in 2014. We used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including the financing of our acquisition of APV. The interest payment dates for these notes are June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes are redeemable, in whole, or in part, at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, at any time prior to December 15, 2010, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.625%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we experience certain types of change of control transactions, we must offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These notes are unsecured and rank equally with all our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The indenture governing these notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consummate some mergers. During the first quarter of 2009, these senior notes became freely tradable. At September 26, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenant provisions of the senior notes. "

2009, May 2009 and March 2009, we repurchased $390.0, $300.0
and $400.0, respectively, of our $1,090.0 face value due at
maturity zero coupon notes. The notes were issued in August 2007 in
a private placement transaction. We paid cash totaling $553.8 to
repurchase the notes, which had a remaining carrying value of zero
at September 30, 2009. On
February 5, 2009, we issued $400.0 of 6.000% notes due 2014
and $600.0 of 7.000% notes due 2019 under our shelf registration
statement. The proceeds from this debt issuance have been used for
general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to,
repayment of current maturities of long-term debt and repurchasing
shares of our common stock. The notes have a call feature that
allows us to repurchase the notes at any time at our option and a
put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase
the notes upon the occurrence of both a change of control event and
a downgrade of the notes. We have a
senior revolving credit facility, or the facility, with certain
lenders for general corporate purposes. The facility, as amended,
provides credit up to $2,392.0, which matures on September 30,
2011. The interest rate on this facility is based on either
(i) the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined percentage rate based
on our credit rating at the date of utilization, or (ii) a
base rate as defined in the facility agreement. Our ability to
borrow under this facility is subject to compliance with certain
covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as
of September 30, 2009 or during the three or nine months then
ended. At September 30, 2009, we had $2,392.0 available under
this facility. We have an
authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds
of which may be used for general corporate purposes. At
September 30, 2009, we had $541.0 outstanding under this
program. Commercial paper borrowings have been classified as
long-term debt at September 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008 in accordance with FASB guidance for short-term obligations
expected to be refinanced, as our practice and intent is to replace
short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with
additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period
extending for more than one year or our ability to redeem our
commercial paper with borrowings under the senior credit facility
described above. We are a member
of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Cincinnati, collectively, the FHLBs, and as a member
we have the ability to obtain cash advances subject to certain
requirements. In order to obtain cash advances, we are required to
pledge securities as collateral to the FHLBs, initially equal to a
certain percentage of the cash borrowings, depending on the type of
securities pledged as collateral. The market value of the
collateral is monitored daily by the FHLBs, and if it falls below
the required percentage of the cash borrowings, we are required to
pledge additional securities as collateral or repay a portion of
the outstanding cash advance balance. In addition, our borrowings
may be limited based on the amount of our investment in the
FHLBs’ common stock. Our investment in the FHLBs’
common stock at September 30, 2009 totaled $7.5, which is
reported in “Investments available-for-sale – Equity
securities” on the consolidated balance sheets. At
September 30, 2009, $100.0 of cash advances from the FHLBs was
outstanding and is reported in “Short-term borrowings”
on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities, primarily certain
U.S. government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a fair
value of $224.5 at September 30, 2009, have been pledged as
collateral. The securities pledged are reported in
“Investments available-for-sale – Fixed maturity
securities” on the consolidated balance sheets.

8. Debt: At
September 30, 2009, Altria Group, Inc. had in place a
multi-year revolving credit facility (the “Revolving
Facility”) in the amount of $3.4 billion, which expires
April 15, 2010. The Revolving Facility is used to support the
issuance of commercial paper to fund short-term cash needs. In June
2009, Altria Group, Inc. amended its Revolving Facility in order to
terminate the $108 million commitment of Aurora Bank FSB (formerly
known as Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB) (“Aurora”).
Aurora’s commitment was terminated without a ratable
termination or reduction of the commitments of the other
lenders. At
September 30, 2009, Altria Group, Inc. had no borrowings under
the Revolving Facility nor was any commercial paper outstanding.
Any commercial paper of Altria Group, Inc. and borrowings under the
Revolving Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PM
USA (see Note 16. Condensed Consolidating Financial
Information). Altria Group,
Inc. expects to replace the Revolving Facility prior to its
expiration in amounts and maturities based on market conditions at
that time. Altria Group, Inc. believes it has adequate liquidity
and access to financial resources to meet its anticipated
obligations in the foreseeable future. At
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, Altria Group,
Inc.’s long-term debt consisted of the following: September 30,

Senior Notes:
Altria Group, Inc. issued
the following notes in February 2009: • $525 million at 7.75%, due 2014, interest payable
semi-annually; • $2.2 billion at 9.25%, due 2019, interest payable
semi-annually; and • $1.5 billion at 10.20%, due 2039, interest payable
semi-annually. The net
proceeds from the issuance of these notes, along with available
cash, were used to prepay all of the outstanding borrowings under
the Bridge Facility (see Note 2. UST Acquisition). Upon such
prepayment, the Bridge Facility was terminated. During the first
quarter of 2009, Altria Group, Inc. incurred structuring and
arrangement fees of $87 million related to the Bridge Facility.
This amount is included in interest and other debt expense, net, in
Altria Group, Inc.’s condensed consolidated statements of
earnings. The notes are Altria Group, Inc.’s senior unsecured
obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Altria
Group, Inc.’s existing and future senior unsecured
indebtedness. The interest rate payable on each series of notes is
subject to adjustment from time to time if the rating assigned to
the notes of such series by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
(“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services (“Standard & Poor’s”)
is downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) as and to the extent set
forth in the terms of the notes. Upon the occurrence of both
(i) a change of control of Altria Group, Inc. and
(ii) the notes ceasing to be rated investment grade by each of
Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings
(“Fitch”) within a specified time period, Altria Group,
Inc. will be required to make an offer to purchase the notes of
each series at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount of such series, plus accrued interest to the date of
repurchase as and to the extent set forth in the terms of the
notes. The obligations of Altria
Group, Inc. under the notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by PM USA (see Note 16. Condensed Consolidating
Financial Information).
UST Debt: At
September 30, 2009, UST’s senior debt consisted of the
following: • $600 million senior notes at 6.625%, due 2012, interest payable
semi-annually; and • $300 million senior notes at 5.75%, due 2018, interest payable
semi-annually. UST senior
notes of $200 million and $40 million matured and were repaid in
June 2009. In addition, UST’s revolving credit facility was
prepaid and terminated in January 2009. The UST notes
are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of
payment with all of UST’s existing and future senior
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. With respect to the $300
million senior notes, upon the occurrence of both (i) a change
of control of UST and (ii) these notes ceasing to be rated
investment grade by each of Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s within a specified time period, UST would be required
to make an offer to purchase these notes at a price equal to 101%
of the aggregate principal amount of such series, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of repurchase as and to the extent set
forth in the terms of these notes.

Group, Inc. and its subsidiary, Altria Finance (Cayman Islands)
Ltd., completed tender offers to purchase for cash $2.3 billion of
notes and debentures denominated in U.S. dollars, and
€373 million in euro-denominated bonds, equivalent to
$568 million in U.S. dollars. As a result of
the tender offers and consent solicitations, Altria Group, Inc.

Credit
Facilities
PHI’s principal
credit source is an unsecured $1.5 billion syndicated credit
facility, which can be used by PHI and its utility subsidiaries to
borrow funds, obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of
commercial paper. This facility is in effect until May 2012 and
consists of commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is
responsible for more than 8.5% of the total $1.5 billion
commitment. PHI’s credit limit under the facility is $875
million. The credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the
lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company
is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities,
except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and
ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625
million.
PHI and its utility
subsidiaries historically have issued commercial paper to meet
their short-term working capital requirements. As a result of
the disruptions in the commercial paper market in 2008, the
companies borrowed under the $1.5 billion credit facility to meet
short-term operating needs. At September 30, 2009, PHI
had an outstanding loan of $100 million under this
facility.
In November 2008, PHI
entered into a second unsecured credit facility in the amount of
$400 million with a syndicate of nine lenders, which was amended
and restated in October 2009 to extend the facility termination
date to October 15, 2010. Under the facility, PHI has access
to revolving and swingline loans over the term of the facility. The
facility does not provide for the issuance of letters of
credit. These two facilities are referred to collectively as
PHI’s “primary credit facilities.”
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing
capacity under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to
meet the future liquidity needs of PHI and its utility subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis totaled $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion,
respectively. PHI’s utility subsidiaries had a combined cash
and borrowing capacity under the $1.5 billion credit facility of
$581 million and $843 million, respectively.
Other Financing
Activities
During the three months
ended September 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred:
In July 2009, Atlantic
City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding) made principal
payments of $5.2 million on Series 2002-1 Bonds, Class A-2,
$1.4 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds, Class A-1, and $.7
million on Series 2003-1 Bonds, Class A-2.
In July 2009, DPL repaid,
at maturity, the remaining $100 million of a short-term loan in the
original amount of $150 million.
In July 2009, PHI’s
utility subsidiaries entered into a $30 million line of credit that
can be used by these entities for equipment leasing through July
2010.
In July 2009, DPL redeemed
$15 million of Series 2003A and $18.2 million of Series 2003B
Exempt Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds issued for the benefit of
DPL by The Delaware Economic Development Authority. These
tax-exempt bonds were purchased by DPL in 2008 due to the
disruptions in the tax-exempt capital markets.
In July 2009, ACE redeemed
$25 million of Series 2004A and $6.5 million of Series 2004B
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued for the benefit of
ACE by the Pollution Control Financing Authority of Cape May County
(collectively, the Cape May Bonds). The Cape May Bonds were
purchased by ACE in 2008 due to the disruptions in the tax-exempt
capital markets. The Cape May Bonds were insured by bond insurance
policies purchased by ACE. At the time of the issuance of the Cape
May Bonds, ACE issued to the bond insurer, as security for its
reimbursement obligations under the bond insurance policies, a
series of senior notes having terms substantially identical to the
terms of the respective series of Cape May Bonds. ACE’s
obligations under the senior notes were, in turn, secured by a
corresponding series of collateral first mortgage bonds issued by
ACE under its Mortgage and Deed of Trust. Upon the redemption of
the Cape May Bonds, the corresponding series of senior notes and
first mortgage bonds were likewise redeemed. In September 2009, DPL
issued $165.5 million of collateral first mortgage bonds in order
to secure its reimbursement obligations under bond insurance
policies insuring the principal and interest payments on a series
of previously issued DPL notes and two series of pollution control
bonds previously issued for the benefit of DPL. DPL did not receive
any cash proceeds from the issuance of the collateral first
mortgage bonds. The payment by DPL of its principal and interest
obligations in respect of the DPL notes and the pollution control
bonds satisfies the corresponding payment obligations on collateral
first mortgage bonds, and accordingly DPL’s outstanding debt
did not increase as a result of these transactions.
Subsequent to
September 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred:
In October 2009, ACE
Funding made principal payments of $7 million on Series 2002-1
Bonds, Class A-2, and $2.7 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds,
Class A-2.
In October 2009, PHI, as
discussed above, extended the term of its $400 million unsecured
credit facility to October 15, 2010.
Collateral
Requirements of the Competitive Energy Business
In conducting its retail
energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of
declining energy prices, has been exposed to the asymmetrical risk
of having to post collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts
without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its
retail customers. To partially address these asymmetrical
collateral obligations, Pepco Energy Services, in the first quarter
of 2009, entered into a credit intermediation arrangement with
Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement,
MSCG, in consideration for the payment to MSCG of certain fees:
(i) has assumed by novation certain electricity purchase
obligations of Pepco Energy Services in years 2009 through 2011
under several wholesale purchase contracts, and (ii) has
agreed to supply electricity to Pepco Energy Services on the same
terms as the novated transactions, but without imposing on Pepco
Energy Services any associated collateral obligations. As of
September 30, 2009, approximately 24% of Pepco Energy
Services’ wholesale electricity purchase obligations
(measured in megawatt hours) were covered by this credit
intermediation arrangement with MSCG. The fees incurred by
Pepco Energy Services in the amount of $25 million are being
amortized into expense in declining amounts over the life of the
arrangement based on the fair value of the underlying contracts at
the time of novation. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2009, approximately $4 million and $12 million,
respectively, of the fees have been amortized and reflected in
interest expense.
In addition to Pepco Energy
Services’ retail energy supply business, Conectiv Energy and
Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business enter into
various other contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and
related products, including derivative instruments, designed to
reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their
assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These
contracts also typically have collateral requirements.
Depending on the contract
terms, the collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy
Services and Conectiv Energy can be of varying forms, including
cash and letters of credit. As of September 30, 2009, Pepco
Energy Services and Conectiv Energy had posted net cash collateral
of $131 million and $214 million, respectively, and letters of
credit of $186 million and $16 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2008, Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy
had posted net cash collateral of $125 million and $206 million,
respectively, and letters of credit of $474 million and $84
million, respectively.
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing
capacity under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to
meet the future liquidity needs of the Competitive Energy business
totaled $822 million and $684 million, respectively.

13. DEBT AND FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS
In March 2009, we issued
$850.0 principal amount of notes payable in a public offering.
$500.0 of the notes bear interest at a per annum coupon rate equal
to 5.625%, payable semi-annually, and mature on March 1, 2014
(the “2014 Notes”). $350.0 of the notes bear interest
at a per annum coupon rate equal to 6.500%, payable semi-annually,
and mature on March 1, 2019. The net proceeds from the
offering of $837.6 were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness
under our commercial paper program and for general corporate
purposes. In connection with the offering of the 2014 Notes, we
entered into five-year interest-rate swap agreements with notional
amounts totaling $500.0 to effectively convert the fixed interest
rate on the 2014 Notes to a variable interest rate, based on
LIBOR.
In September 2009, we
entered into a financing lease obligation for $60.8. The lease
obligation relates to the sale and leaseback of equipment in one of
our distribution facilities in North America.
The indentures under which
the above notes were issued contain certain covenants, including
limits on the incurrence of liens and restrictions on the
incurrence of sale/leaseback transactions and transactions
involving a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of
our assets. At September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with
all covenants in our indentures.

In August 2009, the company issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, maturing in August 2019 and bearing a 4.5% coupon rate. The net proceeds from these issuances were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $200 million of outstanding commercial paper. Additionally, the company repaid approximately $160 million of outstanding borrowings related to the company’s Euro-denominated credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the company’s primary revolving or Euro-denominated credit facilities as of September 30, 2009. "

1,2009-10-29,931148,XBRL," (4) Change in Accounting
for Debentures As mentioned in
Note 2, we were required to retrospectively change our method of
accounting for the Debentures during the period they were
outstanding to comply with ASC 470-20 which required us to separate
the proceeds from the Debentures into two accounting components at
issuance: 1.
a debt component,
representing the fair value of the Debentures as if they had no
conversion rights, and 2.
an equity component,
representing the difference between the proceeds from the issuance
of the Debentures and the fair value of the debt
component. Initial
Measurement Accounting We used an
interest rate of 6.3531% to determine the fair value of the
Debentures as if they had no conversion rights, which resulted in a
fair value of $165.6 million. The remaining $59.4 million was
recorded as additional paid-in capital and debt discount in our
balance sheet. We also allocated the transaction costs to the
liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of
proceeds and accounted for them as debt issuance costs and equity
issuance costs, respectively. The debt
discount and debt issuance costs not allocated to equity were
amortized over the period to the first conversion date (7 years)
using the interest method and recorded as interest expense. Because
the amounts allocated to equity were not deductible for income tax
purposes, we recorded the tax effects as adjustments to additional
paid-in capital. Redemption
Accounting On May 30,
2008, we called for the redemption of the $225.0 million
outstanding principal amount of the Debentures. On June 13,
2008, the redemption date, the Debenture holders who exercised
their conversion rights received 60.3136 shares of our common stock
for each $1,000 principal amount of Debentures on conversion,
together with a make-whole payment totaling $9.0 million, which
represented the present value of all remaining scheduled payments
of interest on the redeemed Debentures from the date of conversion
through January 15, 2011. We also made
payment of $0.2 million to the Debenture holders who did not
exercise their conversion rights and opted to receive a redemption
price in cash equal to 100% of the principal plus accrued but
unpaid interest until the redemption date. These Debenture holders
received the make-whole value in shares. In accordance
with ASC 470-20, we allocated the fair value (determined using an
interest rate of 7.5178%) of the consideration transferred (13.6
million shares of common stock with an aggregate value of $366.4
million) to the fair values of the debt component ($194.7 million)
and the equity component ($171.7 million) immediately prior to the
redemption. A $4.1 million gain was recognized for the difference
between the amount allocated to the debt component and the sum of
the carrying amount of the debt, unamortized debt discount, and
issuance costs at conversion. At redemption, we recorded additional
valuation allowance of $9.9 million as a result of the reduction of
the deferred tax liability for the difference in debt discount and
debt issuance costs expense recognized for financial and tax
reporting. Effect of
Restatement The effect of
adopting this new guidance on our balance sheet at
December 31, 2008, and our statement of operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2008 follows (dollars in
thousands except per share data). There is no impact for the three
months ended September 30, 2008, because the Debentures were
extinguished on June 13, 2008. Previously

capital lease payments as of October 2, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. (L) At October 2, 2009, approximately $814 million of our

CCE. (M) The total fair value of our debt was $9.8 billion and $9.0
billion at October 2, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. The fair value of our debt is determined using quoted
market prices for publicly traded instruments, and for non-publicly
traded instruments through a variety of valuation techniques
depending on the specific characteristics of the debt instrument,
taking into account credit risk. Debt and Credit
Facilities We have amounts
available to us for borrowing under various debt and credit
facilities. These facilities serve as a backstop to our commercial
paper programs and support our working capital needs. Our primary
committed facility matures in 2012 and is a $2.5 billion
multi-currency credit facility with a syndicate of 17 banks. At
October 2, 2009, our availability under this credit facility
was $2.2 billion. The amount available is limited by the aggregate
outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued under the
facility. Based on information currently available to us, we have
no indication that the financial institutions syndicated under this
facility would be unable to fulfill their commitments to us as of
the date of the filing of this report. We also have
uncommitted amounts available under a public debt facility, which
could be used for long-term financing and to refinance debt
maturities and commercial paper. The amounts available under this
public debt facility and the related costs to borrow are subject to
market conditions at the time of borrowing.
Covenants Our credit
facilities and outstanding notes and debentures contain various
provisions that, among other things, require us to limit the
incurrence of certain liens or encumbrances in excess of defined
amounts. Additionally, our credit facilities require that our net
debt to total capital ratio does not exceed a defined amount. We
were in compliance with these requirements as of October 2,
2009. These requirements currently are not, and it is not
anticipated they will become, restrictive to our liquidity or
capital resources.

(9) DEBT
Credit
Facilities
PHI’s principal
credit source is an unsecured $1.5 billion syndicated credit
facility, which can be used by PHI and its utility subsidiaries to
borrow funds, obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of
commercial paper. This facility is in effect until May 2012 and
consists of commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is
responsible for more than 8.5% of the total $1.5 billion
commitment. PHI’s credit limit under the facility is $875
million. The credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the
lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company
is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities,
except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and
ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625
million.
PHI and its utility
subsidiaries historically have issued commercial paper to meet
their short-term working capital requirements. As a result of
the disruptions in the commercial paper market in 2008, the
companies borrowed under the $1.5 billion credit facility to meet
short-term operating needs. At September 30, 2009, PHI
had an outstanding loan of $100 million under this
facility.
In November 2008, PHI
entered into a second unsecured credit facility in the amount of
$400 million with a syndicate of nine lenders, which was amended
and restated in October 2009 to extend the facility termination
date to October 15, 2010. Under the facility, PHI has access
to revolving and swingline loans over the term of the facility. The
facility does not provide for the issuance of letters of
credit. These two facilities are referred to collectively as
PHI’s “primary credit facilities.”
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing
capacity under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to
meet the future liquidity needs of PHI and its utility subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis totaled $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion,
respectively. PHI’s utility subsidiaries had a combined cash
and borrowing capacity under the $1.5 billion credit facility of
$581 million and $843 million, respectively.
Other Financing
Activities
During the three months
ended September 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred:
In July 2009, Atlantic
City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding) made principal
payments of $5.2 million on Series 2002-1 Bonds, Class A-2,
$1.4 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds, Class A-1, and $.7
million on Series 2003-1 Bonds, Class A-2.
In July 2009, DPL repaid,
at maturity, the remaining $100 million of a short-term loan in the
original amount of $150 million.
In July 2009, PHI’s
utility subsidiaries entered into a $30 million line of credit that
can be used by these entities for equipment leasing through July
2010.
In July 2009, DPL redeemed
$15 million of Series 2003A and $18.2 million of Series 2003B
Exempt Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds issued for the benefit of
DPL by The Delaware Economic Development Authority. These
tax-exempt bonds were purchased by DPL in 2008 due to the
disruptions in the tax-exempt capital markets.
In July 2009, ACE redeemed
$25 million of Series 2004A and $6.5 million of Series 2004B
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued for the benefit of
ACE by the Pollution Control Financing Authority of Cape May County
(collectively, the Cape May Bonds). The Cape May Bonds were
purchased by ACE in 2008 due to the disruptions in the tax-exempt
capital markets. The Cape May Bonds were insured by bond insurance
policies purchased by ACE. At the time of the issuance of the Cape
May Bonds, ACE issued to the bond insurer, as security for its
reimbursement obligations under the bond insurance policies, a
series of senior notes having terms substantially identical to the
terms of the respective series of Cape May Bonds. ACE’s
obligations under the senior notes were, in turn, secured by a
corresponding series of collateral first mortgage bonds issued by
ACE under its Mortgage and Deed of Trust. Upon the redemption of
the Cape May Bonds, the corresponding series of senior notes and
first mortgage bonds were likewise redeemed. In September 2009, DPL
issued $165.5 million of collateral first mortgage bonds in order
to secure its reimbursement obligations under bond insurance
policies insuring the principal and interest payments on a series
of previously issued DPL notes and two series of pollution control
bonds previously issued for the benefit of DPL. DPL did not receive
any cash proceeds from the issuance of the collateral first
mortgage bonds. The payment by DPL of its principal and interest
obligations in respect of the DPL notes and the pollution control
bonds satisfies the corresponding payment obligations on collateral
first mortgage bonds, and accordingly DPL’s outstanding debt
did not increase as a result of these transactions.
Subsequent to
September 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred:
In October 2009, ACE
Funding made principal payments of $7 million on Series 2002-1
Bonds, Class A-2, and $2.7 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds,
Class A-2.
In October 2009, PHI, as
discussed above, extended the term of its $400 million unsecured
credit facility to October 15, 2010.
Collateral
Requirements of the Competitive Energy Business
In conducting its retail
energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of
declining energy prices, has been exposed to the asymmetrical risk
of having to post collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts
without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its
retail customers. To partially address these asymmetrical
collateral obligations, Pepco Energy Services, in the first quarter
of 2009, entered into a credit intermediation arrangement with
Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement,
MSCG, in consideration for the payment to MSCG of certain fees:
(i) has assumed by novation certain electricity purchase
obligations of Pepco Energy Services in years 2009 through 2011
under several wholesale purchase contracts, and (ii) has
agreed to supply electricity to Pepco Energy Services on the same
terms as the novated transactions, but without imposing on Pepco
Energy Services any associated collateral obligations. As of
September 30, 2009, approximately 24% of Pepco Energy
Services’ wholesale electricity purchase obligations
(measured in megawatt hours) were covered by this credit
intermediation arrangement with MSCG. The fees incurred by
Pepco Energy Services in the amount of $25 million are being
amortized into expense in declining amounts over the life of the
arrangement based on the fair value of the underlying contracts at
the time of novation. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2009, approximately $4 million and $12 million,
respectively, of the fees have been amortized and reflected in
interest expense.
In addition to Pepco Energy
Services’ retail energy supply business, Conectiv Energy and
Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business enter into
various other contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and
related products, including derivative instruments, designed to
reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their
assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These
contracts also typically have collateral requirements.
Depending on the contract
terms, the collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy
Services and Conectiv Energy can be of varying forms, including
cash and letters of credit. As of September 30, 2009, Pepco
Energy Services and Conectiv Energy had posted net cash collateral
of $131 million and $214 million, respectively, and letters of
credit of $186 million and $16 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2008, Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy
had posted net cash collateral of $125 million and $206 million,
respectively, and letters of credit of $474 million and $84
million, respectively.
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing
capacity under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to
meet the future liquidity needs of the Competitive Energy business
totaled $822 million and $684 million, respectively.

The total cash used for these redemptions was $289.4. As a result of certain holders of the zero-coupon subordinated notes electing to convert their notes, the Company also issued 0.4 additional shares of common s
tock and reversed approximately $11.3 of deferred tax liability to reflect the tax benefit realized upon issuance of these shares. The Company’s common stock trading price conversion feature of its zero-coupon subordinated notes was not triggered by third quarter 2009 trading prices. As a result, the zero-coupon subordinated notes may not be converted during the period of October 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 based on this conversion feature. The Company’s common stock trading price contingent cash interest feature of its zero-coupon subordinated notes was not triggered by the average market price of the Company’s common stock for the five trading days ended September 9, 2009.

At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there were outstanding $108 million principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2031, with an accreted value of $55 million and $54 million, respectively. The Company adopted new FASB guidance regarding accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of this new guidance will have no impact on 2009 results; the Company recorded a $1 million cumulative effect of accounting change as of January 1, 2007 and the adoption had no impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008. At the Company’s request, in late April 2009, the Company and its Bank Group modified the terms of its Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, which expires February 2011. After reviewing its anticipated liquidity position, the Company requested that the maximum amount the Company could borrow under this facility be reduced to $1.25 billion from $2.0 billion; in addition, the debt to total capitalization ratio has been increased from 60 percent to 65 percent. The debt to total capitalization ratio and the minimum net worth covenant have also been amended to allow the add-back, if incurred, of up to the first $500 million of certain non-cash charges, including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges that would negatively impact shareholders’ equity. Under the terms of the Amended Credit Facility, any outstanding Letters of Credit reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity. At September 30, 2009, the Company had $72 million of unused Letters of Credit; accordingly, the Company’s remaining borrowing capacity is approximately $1.2 billion. The Company incurred approximately $2 million of fees and expenses associated with the Amendment. The Company, if the facility is utilized, will incur higher borrowing costs as a result of the Amendment. At September 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with the requirements of the Amended Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility. "

The portion of the proceeds related to the conversion feature has been recognized as additional paid-in capital. In September, the Company completed a two part public offering of $900 and $1,100 senior notes maturing on October 1, 2019 and October 1, 2039, respectively. Net proceeds from the 2019 and 2039 notes were $896 and $1,082, respectively. The 2019 notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 5.125% per annum and the 2039 notes pay semi-annual interest of 6.25% per annum. During the first quarter of 2009, PTNNT shareholders loaned an additional $124 to PTNNT. Total principal outstanding under the shareholder loans was $165 and $41 at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, 43.75% or approximately $72 and $18, respectively, were due to Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation, an affiliate of Sumitomo Mining Corporation, an unrelated third party, and was non-recourse to Newmont, with the remainder payable to Newmont. As further discussed in Note 27, through mid-October 2009 the Company provided a joint and several guarantee for the payment of principal and interest amounts associated with the PTNNT project financing facility, which was non-recourse to Newmont at December 31, 2008. On October 21, 2009, the Company provided letters of credit to the Senior Lenders to secure 56.25% of the PTNNT project financing facility, and as a result, the Company no longer provides a separate corporate guarantee in support of the financing. Scheduled minimum debt repayments at September 30, 2009 are $127 for the remainder of 2009, $157 in 2010, $336 in 2011, $603 in 2012, $116 in 2013 and $3,584 thereafter. "

Wireless On
December 19, 2008, Verizon Wireless and Verizon Wireless
Capital LLC, as the borrowers, entered into a $17.0 billion credit
facility (Bridge Facility). On January 9, 2009, Verizon
Wireless borrowed $12.4 billion under the Bridge Facility in order
to complete the acquisition of Alltel and repay certain of
Alltel’s outstanding debt as described below. Verizon
Wireless used cash generated from operations and the net proceeds
from the sale of the notes described below to repay all of the
borrowings under the Bridge Facility. No borrowings are outstanding
under the Bridge Facility and the commitments under the Bridge
Facility have been terminated. In connection
with the Alltel acquisition, Verizon Wireless assumed approximately
$23.9 billion of debt, of which approximately $2.3 billion remains
outstanding to third parties as of September 30, 2009. Under
the terms of a tender offer that was completed on March 20,
2009, $0.2 billion aggregate principal amount was redeemed for a
loss that was not significant. In February
2009, Verizon Wireless and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC co-issued
$4.3 billion aggregate principal amount of three and five-year
fixed rate notes in a private placement resulting in cash proceeds
of $4.2 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. In May 2009,
Verizon Wireless and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC co-issued $4.0
billion aggregate principal amount of two-year fixed and floating
rate notes in a private placement resulting in cash proceeds of
approximately $4.0 billion, net of discounts and issuance
costs. In June 2009,
Verizon Wireless issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of
floating rate notes due 2011. Commencing on December 27, 2009
and on each quarterly interest payment date thereafter, both the
holders of the notes and Verizon Wireless have the right to require
settlement of all or a portion of these notes at par. Accordingly,
these notes are classified as current maturities in the condensed
consolidated balance sheet. On
August 28, 2009, Verizon Wireless repaid $0.4 billion due
under a three-year term loan facility, reducing the outstanding
borrowings to $4.0 billion. On
October 14, 2009, a registration statement of Verizon Wireless
and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC, which registers a total of
approximately $11.8 billion of new notes, was declared effective by
the SEC, and Verizon Wireless and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC
commenced an exchange offer to exchange the privately placed notes
issued in November of 2008, as well as February and May of 2009 for
new notes with similar terms, pursuant to the requirements of
registration rights agreements. These condensed consolidated
financial statements do not constitute an offer of any securities
for sale. Verizon
Communications In March 2009,
Verizon issued $1.8 billion of 6.35% notes due 2019 and $1.0
billion of 7.35% notes due 2039, resulting in cash proceeds of $2.7
billion, net of discounts and issuance costs, which were used to
reduce our commercial paper borrowings, repay maturing debt and for
general corporate purposes. In December 2008, we entered into a
$0.2 billion vendor provided credit facility and in January 2009,
we borrowed the entire amount available under this
facility. On
October 6, 2009, we redeemed Verizon New Jersey Inc. $0.1
billion 6.8% debentures due December 15, 2024 at a redemption
price of 101.536% of the principal amount of the debentures, plus
accrued and unpaid interest through the date of the redemption.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, $0.3 billion
of 6.7% notes and $0.2 billion of 5.5% notes issued by Verizon
California Inc., $0.2 billion of 5.875% notes issued by Verizon New
England Inc., and $0.5 billion of floating rate notes issued by
Verizon matured and were repaid. On
April 15, 2009, we terminated all commitments under our $6.0
billion three-year credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that
was scheduled to mature in September 2009 and entered into a new
$5.3 billion 364-day credit facility with a group of major
financial institutions. As of September 30, 2009, the unused
borrowing capacity under the 364-day credit facility was
approximately $5.2 billion.
Guarantees We guarantee
the debt obligations of GTE Corporation (but not the debt of its
subsidiary or affiliate companies) that were issued and outstanding
prior to July 1, 2003. In April 2009, $0.5 billion of 7.51%
notes issued by GTE Corporation matured and were repaid. As of
September 30, 2009, $1.7 billion principal amount of these
obligations remain outstanding.
Debt
Covenants As of
September 30, 2009, we and our consolidated subsidiaries are

6,2009-10-29,97216,XBRL," NOTE L - LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS 2006 Credit Agreement On July 14, 2006, the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the 2006 Credit
Agreement) with the lenders party thereto (the Lenders) and
Credit Suisse, as administrative and collateral agent. The 2006
Credit Agreement provides the Company with a revolving line of
credit of up to $550 million available through July 14, 2012 and
term debt of $272.3 million that will mature on July 14, 2013. The
revolving line of credit consists of $350 million of domestic
revolving loans and $200 million of multicurrency revolving loans.
The 2006 Credit Agreement also originally provided for incremental
loan commitments of up to $300 million, which may be extended at
the option of the Lenders or other lenders, subject to the approval
of the administrative agent, in the form of revolving credit loans,
term loans or a combination of both. As discussed below, the
Company drew $136.5 million in incremental term loans under this
commitment during the three months ended September 30, 2009,
leaving up to $163.5 million available. The 2006 Credit Agreement
was amended on January 1, 2008, February 24, 2009 and June 3,
2009. Pursuant to the June 2009 amendment, the Company
reduced its domestic revolving credit commitments under the 2006
Credit Agreement by $150 million, prepaid $58.4 million principal
amount of its term loans thereunder, and increased the interest
rates charged thereunder. The amendment also eliminated certain
existing financial covenants dealing with the Companys
consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage
ratio, and instead will require the Company to maintain liquidity
of not less than $250 million on the last day of each fiscal
quarter through June 30, 2011, and thereafter maintain a specified
senior secured debt leverage ratio. Pursuant to the amendment, the
Company added flexibility in various restrictive covenants and
agreed to provide certain collateral to secure the Companys
obligations under the 2006 Credit Agreement. Additionally under the
amendment, at any time on or prior to June 30, 2011, if the
Companys consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the 2006
Credit Agreement) is greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the Company will be
prohibited from repurchasing shares of its Common Stock, paying
dividends or redeeming debt except with the proceeds of equity
offerings and other than regularly scheduled payments of debt and
debt under the 2006 Credit Agreement. The amendment also included
certain other technical changes. The Company recorded a charge of $3.3 million to
recognize a loss on the write-off of unamortized debt acquisition
costs for the June 2009 amendment and for debt acquisition costs
incurred in connection with the prepayment of existing term
loans. In connection with the acquisition of the Port
Equipment Business, on July 22, 2009, the Company entered into an
Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement (the JPM Incremental
Agreement) with J.P. Morgan Chase International Financing Limited
and on July 23, 2009, the Company entered into an Incremental Term
Loan Assumption Agreement (the Additional Incremental Agreement)
with certain of the Port Equipment Business lenders, both under the
Companys existing credit facility. Pursuant to the JPM Incremental
Agreement, the Company borrowed $66.2 million, which will bear
interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% and mature on July 14, 2013.
Pursuant to the Additional Incremental Agreement, the Company
borrowed $70.3 million, which will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR
plus 3.75% and mature on July 14, 2013. The net proceeds of both
incremental term loans are being used for general corporate
purposes. As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the
Company had $272.3 million and $195.0 million, respectively, of
term loans outstanding under the 2006 Credit Agreement. Term loans
under the 2006 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of LIBOR
plus 3.75% and LIBOR plus 1.75% at September 30, 2009 and December
31, 2008, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the
term loans under the 2006 Credit Agreement at September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008 was 4.03% and 3.21%, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the Company had a balance of
$35.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit component of
the 2006 Credit Agreement. The Company had no revolving credit
amount outstanding as of September 30, 2009. The weighted average
interest rate on the outstanding portion of the 2006 Credit
Agreement revolving credit component at December 31, 2008 was
3.25%. The 2006 Credit Agreement incorporates facilities
for issuance of letters of credit up to $250 million. Letters of
credit issued under the 2006 Credit Agreement letter of credit
facility decrease availability under the $550 million revolving
line of credit. As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the
Company had letters of credit issued under the 2006 Credit
Agreement that totaled $79.3 million and $82.2 million,
respectively. The 2006 Credit Agreement also permits the Company to
have additional letter of credit facilities up to $100 million, and
letters of credit issued under such additional facilities do not
decrease availability under the revolving line of credit. As of
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had letters
of credit issued under the additional letter of credit facilities
of the 2006 Credit Agreement that totaled $10.0 million and $13.9
million, respectively. The Company also has bilateral arrangements
to issue letters of credit with various other financial
institutions. These additional letters of credit do not reduce the
Companys availability under the 2006 Credit
Agreement. The Company had letters of credit issued
under these additional arrangements of $121.4 million and $59.2
million as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. As a result of the acquisition of the Port Equipment
Business, letters of credit increased by $70.9 million under these
additional arrangements. In total, as of September 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of
$210.7 million and $155.3 million, respectively. The 2006 Credit Agreement requires the Company to
comply with a number of covenants. These covenants require the
Company to meet certain financial tests, namely (a) to maintain
liquidity (as defined in the 2006 Credit Agreement) of not less
than $250 million on the last day of each fiscal quarter through
June 30, 2011, and (b) thereafter, to maintain a senior secured
debt leverage ratio (as defined in the 2006 Credit Agreement) not
in excess of 3.50 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter, with
the ratio declining to 3.00 to 1.00 effective October 1, 2012 and
2.50 to 1.00 effective October 1, 2013. The covenants also limit,
in certain circumstances, Terexs ability to take a variety of
actions, including: incur indebtedness; create or maintain liens on
its property or assets; make investments, loans and advances;
engage in acquisitions, mergers, consolidations and asset sales;
and pay dividends and distributions, including share repurchases.
The 2006 Credit Agreement also contains customary events of
default. The Companys future compliance with its financial
covenants under the 2006 Credit Agreement will depend on its
ability to generate earnings and manage its assets effectively. The
2006 Credit Agreement also has various non-financial covenants,
both requiring the Company to refrain from taking certain future
actions (as described above) and requiring the Company to take
certain actions, such as keeping in good standing its corporate
existence, maintaining insurance, and providing its bank lending
group with financial information on a timely basis. Based on its recent financial performance and the
Companys consolidated leverage ratio being greater than 3.75 to
1.00, the Company currently is subject to certain restrictions
under the 2006 Credit Agreement with respect to its uses of cash,
including limitations in making acquisitions, repurchasing shares
of its Common Stock, paying dividends, redeeming debt except with
the proceeds of equity offerings and other than regularly scheduled
payments of debt and debt under the 2006 Credit Agreement and
incurring additional debt. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries agreed
to take certain actions to secure borrowings under the 2006 Credit
Agreement. As a result, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries
entered into an Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral
Agreement with Credit Suisse, as collateral agent for the Lenders,
granting security to the Lenders for amounts borrowed under the
2006 Credit Agreement. The Company is required to (a) pledge as
collateral the capital stock of the Companys material domestic
subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain of the
Companys material foreign subsidiaries, and (b) provide a first
priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all
of the Companys domestic assets. 10-7/8% Senior Notes On June 3, 2009, the Company sold and issued $300
million aggregate principal amount of 10-7/8% Senior Notes Due 2016
sold at 97.633% (10-7/8% Notes). The Company used a portion of
the approximately $293 million proceeds from the offering of the
10-7/8% Notes, together with a portion of the proceeds from the 4%
Convertible Notes discussed below, to prepay a portion of its term
loans under the 2006 Credit Agreement and to pay off the
outstanding balance under the revolving credit component of the
2006 Credit Agreement. The 10-7/8% Notes are not currently
guaranteed by any of the Companys subsidiaries, but under
specified limited circumstances, along with the 4% Convertible
Notes and the 8% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2017 (8% Notes),
could be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company
in the future. The 10-7/8% Notes are redeemable by the Company
beginning in June 2013 at an initial redemption price of 105.438%
of principal amount. 4% Convertible Senior Subordinated
Notes On June 3, 2009, the Company sold and issued $172.5
million aggregate principal amount of 4% Convertible Notes. In
certain circumstances and during certain periods, the 4%
Convertible Notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate
of 61.5385 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of
convertible notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of
approximately $16.25 per share of common stock, subject to
adjustment in some events. Upon conversion, Terex will deliver cash
up to the aggregate principal amount of the 4% Convertible Notes to
be converted and shares of Common Stock with respect to the
remainder, if any, of Terexs convertible obligation in excess of
the aggregate principal amount of the 4% Convertible Notes being
converted. The 4% Convertible Notes are not currently guaranteed by
any of the Companys subsidiaries, but under specified limited
circumstances, along with the 10-7/8% Notes and 8% Senior
Subordinated Notes, could be guaranteed by certain domestic
subsidiaries of the Company in the future. The Company, as issuer of the 4% Convertible Notes,
must separately account for the liability and equity components of
the 4% Convertible Notes in a manner that reflects the Companys
nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance when
interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. The Company
allocated $54.3 million of the $172.5 million principal amount of
the 4% Convertible Notes to the equity component, which represents
a discount to the debt and will be amortized into interest expense
using the effective interest method through June 2015. The Company
recorded a related deferred tax liability of $19.4 million on the
equity component. The balance of the 4% Convertible Notes was
$120.4 million at September 30, 2009. Accordingly, the Companys
effective interest rate on the 4% Convertible Notes will be
11.375%, so the Company will recognize interest expense during the
twelve months ended June 2010 on the 4% Convertible Notes in an
amount that approximates 11.375% of $118.2 million, the liability
component of the 4% Convertible Notes at the date of issuance. The
Company recognized interest expense of $3.4 million and $4.4
million on the 4% Convertible Notes for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2009, respectively. The interest expense
recognized for the 4% Convertible Notes will increase as the
discount is amortized using the effective interest method, which
accretes the debt balance over its term to $172.5 million at
maturity. Interest expense on the 4% Convertible Notes throughout
its term includes 4% annually of cash interest on the maturity
balance of $172.5 million plus non-cash interest expense accreted
to the debt balance as described. The 4% Convertible Notes are
classified as long-term debt in the Companys Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2009 based on their
June 2015 maturity date. 8% Senior Subordinated Notes On November 13, 2007, the Company sold and issued
$800 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Notes. The 8% Notes
are not currently guaranteed by any of the Companys subsidiaries,
but under specified limited circumstances, along with the 10-7/8%
Notes and the 4% Convertible Notes, could be guaranteed by certain
domestic subsidiaries of the Company in the future. The 8% Notes
are redeemable by the Company beginning in November 2012 at an
initial redemption price of 104.000% of principal
amount. 7-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes As of September 30, 2009, the Company had $298.9
million aggregate principal amount of 7-3/8% Senior Subordinated
Notes Due 2014 (7-3/8% Notes) outstanding. The 7-3/8% Notes are
jointly and severally guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries
of the Company (see Note P - Consolidating Financial Statements).
The 7-3/8% Notes were redeemable by the Company beginning in
January 2009 at an initial redemption price of 103.688% of
principal amount. The Company does not currently plan to redeem
these notes. Based on quoted market values and indicative price
quotations from financial institutions, the Company estimates that
the fair values of the 7-3/8% Notes, 8% Notes, 4% Convertible Notes
(net of discount), 10-7/8% Notes and the term debt under the 2006
Credit Agreement were approximately $298 million, $736 million,
$180 million, $321 million and $267 million, respectively as of
September 30, 2009. The Company believes that the carrying value of
its other borrowings approximates fair market value based on
discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for
debt of similar terms and remaining maturities. The terms of the senior notes, senior subordinated
notes and convertible notes described above contain certain
restrictions that impact the Companys ability to make further
borrowings and its use of cash. "

Credit Facility At September 30, 2009, PG&E Corporation had no borrowings outstanding under its $187 million revolving credit facility. PG&E Corporation amended its revolving credit facility on April 27, 2009 to remove Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (“Lehman Bank”) as a lender. Prior to the amendment, the total borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $200 million, including a commitment from Lehman Bank that represented $13 million, or 7%, of the total. Utility Senior Notes On March 6, 2009, the Utility issued $550 million principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due March 1, 2039. On June 11, 2009, the Utility issued $500 million principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due June 10, 2010. The interest rate for the Floating Rate Senior Notes is equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 0.95% and will reset quarterly beginning on September 10, 2009. At September 30, 2009, the interest rate on the Floating Rate Senior Notes was 1.25%. Pollution Control Bonds The California Pollution Control Financing Authority and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (“CIEDB”), serving as conduit issuer, have issued various series of tax-exempt pollution control bonds for the benefit of the Utility. On September 1, 2009, the CIEDB issued $149 million of tax-exempt pollution control bonds series 2009 A and B due on November 1, 2026 and $160 million of tax-exempt pollution control bonds series 2009 C and D due on December 1, 2016. The proceeds were used to repurchase the corresponding series of 2008 pollution cont
rol bonds. The series 2009 bonds, issued at par with an initial rate of 0.20%, are variable rate demand notes with interest resetting daily and backed by direct-pay letters of credit. Unlike the series 2008 bonds, interest earned on the series 2009 bonds is not subject to the alternative minimum tax (“AMT”). A provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allows certain tax-exempt bonds that are subject to AMT to be reissued or refunded in 2009 or 2010 as tax-exempt bonds that are not subject to AMT. As a result, the series 2009 bonds were issued at a lower interest rate, reducing the Utility’s interest expense. Credit Facility and Short-Term Borrowings At September 30, 2009, the Utility had $273 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Utility’s $1.94 billion revolving credit facility. The Utility amended its revolving credit facility on April 27, 2009 to remove Lehman Bank as a lender. Prior to the amendment, the total borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $2.0 billion, including a commitment from Lehman Bank that represented $60 million, or 3%, of the total. The revolving credit facility also provides liquidity support for commercial paper offerings. At September 30, 2009, the Utility had no commercial paper outstanding. Energy Recovery Bonds PG&E Energy Recovery Funding LLC, a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of the Utility, issued two separate series of ERBs in the aggregate amount of $2.7 billion in 2005. The proceeds of the ERBs were used by PERF to purchase from the Utility the right, known as “recovery property,” to be paid a specified amount from a dedicated rate component. The total amount of ERB principal outstanding was $1.3 billion at September 30, 2009. While PERF is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Utility, it is legally separate from the Utility. The assets, including the recovery property, of PERF are not available to creditors of the Utility or PG&E Corporation, and the recovery property is not legally an asset of the Utility or PG&E Corporation.

Credit
Facilities
PHI’s principal
credit source is an unsecured $1.5 billion syndicated credit
facility, which can be used by PHI and its utility subsidiaries to
borrow funds, obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of
commercial paper. This facility is in effect until May 2012 and
consists of commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is
responsible for more than 8.5% of the total $1.5 billion
commitment. PHI’s credit limit under the facility is $875
million. The credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the
lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company
is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities,
except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and
ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625
million.
PHI and its utility
subsidiaries historically have issued commercial paper to meet
their short-term working capital requirements. As a result of
the disruptions in the commercial paper market in 2008, the
companies borrowed under the $1.5 billion credit facility to meet
short-term operating needs. At September 30, 2009, PHI
had an outstanding loan of $100 million under this
facility.
In November 2008, PHI
entered into a second unsecured credit facility in the amount of
$400 million with a syndicate of nine lenders, which was amended
and restated in October 2009 to extend the facility termination
date to October 15, 2010. Under the facility, PHI has access
to revolving and swingline loans over the term of the facility. The
facility does not provide for the issuance of letters of
credit. These two facilities are referred to collectively as
PHI’s “primary credit facilities.”
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing
capacity under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to
meet the future liquidity needs of PHI and its utility subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis totaled $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion,
respectively. PHI’s utility subsidiaries had a combined cash
and borrowing capacity under the $1.5 billion credit facility of
$581 million and $843 million, respectively.
Other Financing
Activities
During the three months
ended September 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred:
In July 2009, Atlantic
City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding) made principal
payments of $5.2 million on Series 2002-1 Bonds, Class A-2,
$1.4 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds, Class A-1, and $.7
million on Series 2003-1 Bonds, Class A-2.
In July 2009, DPL repaid,
at maturity, the remaining $100 million of a short-term loan in the
original amount of $150 million.
In July 2009, PHI’s
utility subsidiaries entered into a $30 million line of credit that
can be used by these entities for equipment leasing through July
2010.
In July 2009, DPL redeemed
$15 million of Series 2003A and $18.2 million of Series 2003B
Exempt Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds issued for the benefit of
DPL by The Delaware Economic Development Authority. These
tax-exempt bonds were purchased by DPL in 2008 due to the
disruptions in the tax-exempt capital markets.
In July 2009, ACE redeemed
$25 million of Series 2004A and $6.5 million of Series 2004B
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued for the benefit of
ACE by the Pollution Control Financing Authority of Cape May County
(collectively, the Cape May Bonds). The Cape May Bonds were
purchased by ACE in 2008 due to the disruptions in the tax-exempt
capital markets. The Cape May Bonds were insured by bond insurance
policies purchased by ACE. At the time of the issuance of the Cape
May Bonds, ACE issued to the bond insurer, as security for its
reimbursement obligations under the bond insurance policies, a
series of senior notes having terms substantially identical to the
terms of the respective series of Cape May Bonds. ACE’s
obligations under the senior notes were, in turn, secured by a
corresponding series of collateral first mortgage bonds issued by
ACE under its Mortgage and Deed of Trust. Upon the redemption of
the Cape May Bonds, the corresponding series of senior notes and
first mortgage bonds were likewise redeemed. In September 2009, DPL
issued $165.5 million of collateral first mortgage bonds in order
to secure its reimbursement obligations under bond insurance
policies insuring the principal and interest payments on a series
of previously issued DPL notes and two series of pollution control
bonds previously issued for the benefit of DPL. DPL did not receive
any cash proceeds from the issuance of the collateral first
mortgage bonds. The payment by DPL of its principal and interest
obligations in respect of the DPL notes and the pollution control
bonds satisfies the corresponding payment obligations on collateral
first mortgage bonds, and accordingly DPL’s outstanding debt
did not increase as a result of these transactions.
Subsequent to
September 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred:
In October 2009, ACE
Funding made principal payments of $7 million on Series 2002-1
Bonds, Class A-2, and $2.7 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds,
Class A-2.
In October 2009, PHI, as
discussed above, extended the term of its $400 million unsecured
credit facility to October 15, 2010.
Collateral
Requirements of the Competitive Energy Business
In conducting its retail
energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of
declining energy prices, has been exposed to the asymmetrical risk
of having to post collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts
without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its
retail customers. To partially address these asymmetrical
collateral obligations, Pepco Energy Services, in the first quarter
of 2009, entered into a credit intermediation arrangement with
Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement,
MSCG, in consideration for the payment to MSCG of certain fees:
(i) has assumed by novation certain electricity purchase
obligations of Pepco Energy Services in years 2009 through 2011
under several wholesale purchase contracts, and (ii) has
agreed to supply electricity to Pepco Energy Services on the same
terms as the novated transactions, but without imposing on Pepco
Energy Services any associated collateral obligations. As of
September 30, 2009, approximately 24% of Pepco Energy
Services’ wholesale electricity purchase obligations
(measured in megawatt hours) were covered by this credit
intermediation arrangement with MSCG. The fees incurred by
Pepco Energy Services in the amount of $25 million are being
amortized into expense in declining amounts over the life of the
arrangement based on the fair value of the underlying contracts at
the time of novation. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2009, approximately $4 million and $12 million,
respectively, of the fees have been amortized and reflected in
interest expense.
In addition to Pepco Energy
Services’ retail energy supply business, Conectiv Energy and
Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business enter into
various other contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and
related products, including derivative instruments, designed to
reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their
assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These
contracts also typically have collateral requirements.
Depending on the contract
terms, the collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy
Services and Conectiv Energy can be of varying forms, including
cash and letters of credit. As of September 30, 2009, Pepco
Energy Services and Conectiv Energy had posted net cash collateral
of $131 million and $214 million, respectively, and letters of
credit of $186 million and $16 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2008, Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy
had posted net cash collateral of $125 million and $206 million,
respectively, and letters of credit of $474 million and $84
million, respectively.
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing
capacity under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to
meet the future liquidity needs of the Competitive Energy business
totaled $822 million and $684 million, respectively.

The notes are due March 1, 2019, and pay interest semi-annually at 81⁄4%. Debt issuance costs of approximately $2 million were incurred and are being amortized to expense over the life of the debt issue. Substantially all of the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility maturing 2012. The notes are senior unsecured debt and will rank pari passu with any of our other senior unsecured indebtedness with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. On May 11, 2009, we made the final $25 million installment payment to the seller of properties we purchased in 2007. Interest on the unpaid amount was due quarterly and accrued at a LIBOR rate plus .30%. The interest rate was 1.51% at the date of payment. On July 22, 2009, we repurchased $5 million of our 71⁄4% Senior Debentures due August 1, 2097, recognizing a debt extinguishment gain of $1 million, which is included in other non-operating (income) expense, net. On October 6, 2009, we entered into a lease agreement which will result in the recording of an additional long-term obligation in our balance sheet, as the related asset is constructed.

entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). At September 30, 2009, the Agreement included a $900.0 million
revolving credit facility, a 225.0 million Australian dollar term
loan, and a 110.8 million Canadian dollar term loan, each of which
has a final maturity date of June 15, 2012. It also
included a $191.5 million term loan and a 191.5 million term loan,
each of which has a final maturity date of June 14,
2013. As a result of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, the Company believes that the
maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility was
reduced by $32.3 million. After further deducting amounts
attributable to letters of credit and overdraft facilities that are
supported by the revolving credit facility, at September 30,
2009 the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of $761.2
million available under the Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings
outstanding under the Agreement at September 30, 2009 was
2.40%. During May 2009, a subsidiary of the Company issued
senior notes with a face value of $600.0 million issued at 96.72%
of face value for an effective interest rate of 8.00%. The
notes bear interest at 7.375% and are due May 15, 2016. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys
domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting
commissions and expenses from the notes, approximated $568 million
and were used to purchase in a tender offer $221.9 million of the
$250 million principal amount of 7.50% Senior Debentures due
May 2010 and to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit
facility. The balance of the proceeds increased cash. As a part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender
offer, the Company recorded in the second quarter of 2009
additional interest charges of $5.2 million for note repurchase
premiums and the related write-off of unamortized finance fees, net
of a gain from the termination of the interest rate swap agreement
on the notes. During October 2006, the Company entered into a 300
million European accounts receivable securitization program. The program extends through October 2011, subject to annual
renewal of backup credit lines. In addition, the Company
participates in a receivables financing program in the Asia Pacific
region with a revolving funding commitment of 85 million Australian
dollars and 25 million New Zealand dollars that expire
January 2010 and November 2009, respectively. Information related to the Companys accounts receivable
securitization programs is as follows: Sept. 30, Dec. 31, Sept. 30, 2009 2008 2008 Balance (included in short-term loans) $ 289.4 $ 293.7 $ 390.5 Weighted average interest rate 1.70 % 5.31 % 6.00 % The carrying amounts reported for the accounts receivable
securitization programs, and certain long-term debt obligations
subject to frequently redetermined interest rates, approximate fair

Credit
Facilities
PHI’s principal
credit source is an unsecured $1.5 billion syndicated credit
facility, which can be used by PHI and its utility subsidiaries to
borrow funds, obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of
commercial paper. This facility is in effect until May 2012 and
consists of commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is
responsible for more than 8.5% of the total $1.5 billion
commitment. PHI’s credit limit under the facility is $875
million. The credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the
lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company
is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities,
except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and
ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625
million.
PHI and its utility
subsidiaries historically have issued commercial paper to meet
their short-term working capital requirements. As a result of
the disruptions in the commercial paper market in 2008, the
companies borrowed under the $1.5 billion credit facility to meet
short-term operating needs. At September 30, 2009, PHI
had an outstanding loan of $100 million under this
facility.
In November 2008, PHI
entered into a second unsecured credit facility in the amount of
$400 million with a syndicate of nine lenders, which was amended
and restated in October 2009 to extend the facility termination
date to October 15, 2010. Under the facility, PHI has access
to revolving and swingline loans over the term of the facility. The
facility does not provide for the issuance of letters of
credit. These two facilities are referred to collectively as
PHI’s “primary credit facilities.”
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing
capacity under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to
meet the future liquidity needs of PHI and its utility subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis totaled $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion,
respectively. PHI’s utility subsidiaries had a combined cash
and borrowing capacity under the $1.5 billion credit facility of
$581 million and $843 million, respectively.
Other Financing
Activities
During the three months
ended September 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred:
In July 2009, Atlantic
City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding) made principal
payments of $5.2 million on Series 2002-1 Bonds, Class A-2,
$1.4 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds, Class A-1, and $.7
million on Series 2003-1 Bonds, Class A-2.
In July 2009, DPL repaid,
at maturity, the remaining $100 million of a short-term loan in the
original amount of $150 million.
In July 2009, PHI’s
utility subsidiaries entered into a $30 million line of credit that
can be used by these entities for equipment leasing through July
2010.
In July 2009, DPL redeemed
$15 million of Series 2003A and $18.2 million of Series 2003B
Exempt Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds issued for the benefit of
DPL by The Delaware Economic Development Authority. These
tax-exempt bonds were purchased by DPL in 2008 due to the
disruptions in the tax-exempt capital markets.
In July 2009, ACE redeemed
$25 million of Series 2004A and $6.5 million of Series 2004B
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued for the benefit of
ACE by the Pollution Control Financing Authority of Cape May County
(collectively, the Cape May Bonds). The Cape May Bonds were
purchased by ACE in 2008 due to the disruptions in the tax-exempt
capital markets. The Cape May Bonds were insured by bond insurance
policies purchased by ACE. At the time of the issuance of the Cape
May Bonds, ACE issued to the bond insurer, as security for its
reimbursement obligations under the bond insurance policies, a
series of senior notes having terms substantially identical to the
terms of the respective series of Cape May Bonds. ACE’s
obligations under the senior notes were, in turn, secured by a
corresponding series of collateral first mortgage bonds issued by
ACE under its Mortgage and Deed of Trust. Upon the redemption of
the Cape May Bonds, the corresponding series of senior notes and
first mortgage bonds were likewise redeemed. In September 2009, DPL
issued $165.5 million of collateral first mortgage bonds in order
to secure its reimbursement obligations under bond insurance
policies insuring the principal and interest payments on a series
of previously issued DPL notes and two series of pollution control
bonds previously issued for the benefit of DPL. DPL did not receive
any cash proceeds from the issuance of the collateral first
mortgage bonds. The payment by DPL of its principal and interest
obligations in respect of the DPL notes and the pollution control
bonds satisfies the corresponding payment obligations on collateral
first mortgage bonds, and accordingly DPL’s outstanding debt
did not increase as a result of these transactions.
Subsequent to
September 30, 2009, the following financing activities
occurred:
In October 2009, ACE
Funding made principal payments of $7 million on Series 2002-1
Bonds, Class A-2, and $2.7 million on Series 2003-1 Bonds,
Class A-2.
In October 2009, PHI, as
discussed above, extended the term of its $400 million unsecured
credit facility to October 15, 2010.
Collateral
Requirements of the Competitive Energy Business
In conducting its retail
energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of
declining energy prices, has been exposed to the asymmetrical risk
of having to post collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts
without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its
retail customers. To partially address these asymmetrical
collateral obligations, Pepco Energy Services, in the first quarter
of 2009, entered into a credit intermediation arrangement with
Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement,
MSCG, in consideration for the payment to MSCG of certain fees:
(i) has assumed by novation certain electricity purchase
obligations of Pepco Energy Services in years 2009 through 2011
under several wholesale purchase contracts, and (ii) has
agreed to supply electricity to Pepco Energy Services on the same
terms as the novated transactions, but without imposing on Pepco
Energy Services any associated collateral obligations. As of
September 30, 2009, approximately 24% of Pepco Energy
Services’ wholesale electricity purchase obligations
(measured in megawatt hours) were covered by this credit
intermediation arrangement with MSCG. The fees incurred by
Pepco Energy Services in the amount of $25 million are being
amortized into expense in declining amounts over the life of the
arrangement based on the fair value of the underlying contracts at
the time of novation. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2009, approximately $4 million and $12 million,
respectively, of the fees have been amortized and reflected in
interest expense.
In addition to Pepco Energy
Services’ retail energy supply business, Conectiv Energy and
Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business enter into
various other contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and
related products, including derivative instruments, designed to
reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their
assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These
contracts also typically have collateral requirements.
Depending on the contract
terms, the collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy
Services and Conectiv Energy can be of varying forms, including
cash and letters of credit. As of September 30, 2009, Pepco
Energy Services and Conectiv Energy had posted net cash collateral
of $131 million and $214 million, respectively, and letters of
credit of $186 million and $16 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2008, Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy
had posted net cash collateral of $125 million and $206 million,
respectively, and letters of credit of $474 million and $84
million, respectively.
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing
capacity under PHI’s primary credit facilities available to
meet the future liquidity needs of the Competitive Energy business
totaled $822 million and $684 million, respectively.

Debt The following table summarizes the major components of debt at each balance sheet date (in millions) and provides the maturities and interest rates of each major category as of September 30, 2009: September 30, December 31, 2009 2008 Revolving credit facility (weighted average interest rate of 2.4% at December 31, 2008) $ — $ 300 Letter of credit facilities — — Canadian credit facility (weighted average interest rate of 2.0% at September 30, 2009 and 3.3% at December 31, 2008) 269 242 Senior notes and debentures, maturing through 2032, interest rates ranging from 5.0% to 7.75% (weighted average interest rate of 6.9% at September 30, 2009 and 6.8% at December 31, 2008) 4,884 4,628 Tax-exempt bonds maturing through 2039, fixed and variable interest rates ranging from 0.2% to 7.4% (weighted average interest rate of 3.6% at September 30, 2009 and 3.9% at December 31, 2008) 2,649 2,684 Tax-exempt project bonds, principal payable in periodic installments, maturing through 2029, fixed and variable interest rates ranging from 0.3% to 9.3% (weighted average interest rate of 4.4% at September 30, 2009 and 4.9% at December 31, 2008) 194 220 Capital leases and other, maturing through 2050, interest rates up to 12% 250 252 Total long-term debt 8,246 8,326 Current portion of long-term debt 742 835 Long-term debt, less current portion $ 7,504 $ 7,491 As of September 30, 2009, we had (i) $1,014 million of debt maturing within twelve months, consisting primarily of $269 million under our Canadian credit facility and $600 million of 7.375% senior notes that mature in August 2010; and (ii) $723 million of fixed-rate tax-exempt borrowings subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, this $1,737 million of debt must be classified as current unless we have the intent and ability to refinance it on a long-term basis. As discussed below, as of September 30, 2009, we had the intent and ability to refinance $995 million of this debt on a long-term basis. We have classified the remaining $742 million as current obligations as of September 30, 2009. All of the borrowings outstanding under the Canadian credit facility mature less than one year from the date of issuance, but may be renewed under the terms of the facility, which matures in November 2012. As of September 30, 2009, we intend to repay $18 million of the outstanding borrowings under the facility with available cash during the next twelve months and refinance the remaining balance under the terms of the facility. As a result, as of September 30, 2009, $251 million of advances under the facility were classified as long-term based on our intent and ability to refinance the obligations on a long-term basis under the terms of the facility. Additionally, we have classified the $723 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to re-pricing within twelve months as long-term as of September 30, 2009 based on our intent and ability to refinance any failed re-pricings using our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility. Although we also intend to refinance the $600 million of senior notes maturing in August 2010 on a long-term basis, an aggregate of $1,632 million of capacity under our revolving credit facility is currently utilized to support outstanding letters of credit and we currently expect our utilization of the facility for this purpose to increase by $24 million during the next twelve months. After giving effect to these items, only $21 million of capacity is forecasted to be available under the revolving credit facility, giving us the ability to classify only $21 million of the August 2010 maturity as long-term as of September 30, 2009. The significant changes in our debt balances from December 31, 2008 to September 30, 2009 are related to the following: • Revolving credit facility — We repaid the $300 million of outstanding borrowings with proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, discussed below. • Canadian credit facility — The increase in the carrying value is due to (i) accounting for changes in the Canadian currency translation rate, which increased the carrying value by $33 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, and (ii) the impact of interest accretion, which increased the carrying value by $5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. These increases were partially offset by $11 million of debt repayments. • Senior notes — In February 2009, we issued $350 million of 6.375% senior notes due March 11, 2015 and $450 million of 7.375% senior notes due March 11, 2019. The net proceeds from the debt issuance were $793 million. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay $300 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the remaining proceeds were used to repay $500 million of 6.875% senior notes that matured in May 2009. The remaining change in the carrying value of our senior notes from December 31, 2008 to September 30, 2009 is due to accounting for our fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, which are accounted for as fair value hedges resulting in all fair value adjustments being reflected as a component of the carrying value of the underlying debt. For additional information regarding our interest rate derivatives, refer to Note 11. • Tax-exempt bonds — We issued $30 million of tax-exempt bonds during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The proceeds from the issuance of the bonds were deposited directly into a trust fund and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised. Accordingly, the restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not been included in “New Borrowings” in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, $65 million of our tax-exempt bonds were repaid with available cash. • Tax-exempt project bonds — Tax-exempt project bonds have been used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the development of waste-to-energy facilities. These facilities are integral to the local communities they serve, and, as such, are supported by long-term contracts with multiple municipalities. The bonds generally have periodic amortizations that are supported by the cash flow of each specific facility being financed. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we repaid $26 million of our tax-exempt project bonds with debt service funds and available cash. "

4. Debt In February 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc. (“WDTI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five-year Credit Agreement (“Credit Facility”) that provides for a $750 million unsecured loan consisting of a $500 million term loan facility and a $250 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as swingline. In addition, WDTI may elect to expand the Credit Facility by up to $250 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments. The $500 million term loan had a variable interest rate of 1.50% as of October 2, 2009 and requires sixteen quarterly principal payments, which began in June 2009, of approximately $19 million, $25 million, $31 million and $50 million per quarter for each four-quarter increment. As of October 2, 2009, WDTI had $250 million available for future borrowings on the revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants. "

;nbsp; Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., which is committed to fund up to $70 million of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, filed for bankruptcy in October 2008. Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank, which has not filed for bankruptcy, is committed to fund up to $12 million of Williams Partners L.P.’s $200 million revolving credit facility. We expect that our ability to borrow under these facilities is reduced by these committed amounts. The committed amounts of other participating banks under these agreements remain in effect and are not impacted by the above. In second-quarter 2009, two of our unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $500 million expired and were not renewed. These facilities were originated primarily in support of our former power business. Issuances On March 5, 2009, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75 percent senior unsecured notes due 2020 to certain institutional investors in a private debt placement. In August 2009, we completed an exchange of these notes for substantially identical new notes that are registered under the Securitie

163,519 (1) We entered into an interest rate swap contract related to this loan. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. We did not have any short-term debt at September 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. Revolving Credit Facility On September 4, 2009, we entered into a revolving credit facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement among First Solar, Inc., certain designated Borrowing Subsidiaries (consisting of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a German subsidiary, and other subsidiaries of our Company who may in the future be designated as borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement) and several lenders. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America served as Joint-Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners, with JPMorgan also acting as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement provides First Solar, Inc. and the Borrowing Subsidiaries with a senior secured three-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate available amount of $300.0 million, a portion of which is available for letters of credit and swingline loans. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to request an increase in the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility up to $400.0 million. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we also entered into a guarantee and collateral agreement and foreign security agreements. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement currently bear interest at (i) LIBOR (adjusted for eurocurrency reserve requirements) plus a margin of 2.75% or (ii) a base rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus a margin of 1.75%, depending on the type of borrowing requested by us. These margins are subject to adjustments depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio and the credit rating of the facility provided by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor’s Rating Services. At September 26, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and $14.0 million in letters of credit drawn on the revolving credit facility, leaving approximately $286.0 million in capacity available under the revolving credit facility, $61.0 million of which may be used for letters of credit. As of this date, based on the indices, the all-in effective three months LIBOR borrowing rate was 3.51%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a commitment fee currently at the rate of 0.375% per annum to the lenders in respect of the average daily unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee may also be adjusted due to changes in the consolidated leverage ratio. We will also pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency revolving loans on the face amount of each letter of credit and a fronting fee. Proceeds from the credit facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement contains various financial condition covenants which we must comply with, including with respect to a debt to EBITDA ratio, minimum EBITDA and minimum liquidity. Under the Credit Agreement we are also subject to customary non-financial covenants including limitations in secured indebtedness and limitations on dividends and other restricted payments. We were in compliance with these covenants through September 26, 2009. Malaysian Facility Agreement On May 6, 2008, in connection with the plant expansion at our Malaysian manufacturing center, First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (FS Malaysia), our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an export financing facility agreement (Malaysian Facility Agreement) with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB), as arranger, NATIXIS Zweigniederlassung Deutschland (NZD), as facility agent and original lender, AKA Ausfuhrkredit-Gesellschaft mbH (AKA), as original lender, and NATIXIS Labuan Branch (NLB), as security agent. The total available loan amount was €134.0 million ($197.0 million at the balance sheet close rate on September 26, 2009 of $1.47/€1.00). Pursuant to the Malaysia Facility Agreement, we began semi-annual repayments of the principal balances of these credit facilities during 2008. Amounts repaid under this credit facility cannot be re-borrowed. These credit facilities consisted of the following (in thousands): Outstanding at September 26, Malaysian Borrowings Denomination Interest Maturity 2009 Fixed-rate euro-denominated term loan EUR 4.54

(1) (1) €126.3 million outstanding at September 26, 2009 ($185.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on September 26, 2009 of $1.47/€1.00) These credit facilities are intended to be used by FS Malaysia for the purpose of (1) partially financing the purchase of certain equipment to be used at our Malaysian manufacturing center and (2) financing fees to be paid to Euler-Hermes Kreditversicherungs-AG (Euler-Hermes), the German Export Credit Agency of Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany, which guarantees 95% of FS Malaysia’s obligations related to the Malaysian Facility Agreement (Hermes Guaranty). In addition, FS Malaysia’s obligations related to the Malaysian Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar, Inc., pursuant to a guaranty agreement. FS Malaysia is obligated to pay commitment fees at an annual rate of 0.375% on the unused portions of the fixed rate credit facilities and at an annual rate of 0.350% on the unused portions of the floating rate credit facilities. In addition, FS Malaysia is obligated to pay certain underwriting, management and agency fees in connection with the credit facilities. In connection with the Facility Agreement, First Solar, Inc. entered into a first demand guaranty agreement dated May 6, 2008 in favor of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Malaysian Facility Agreement. As noted above, FS Malaysia’s obligations related to the Malaysian Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar, Inc. pursuant to this guaranty agreement. In connection with the Malaysian Facility Agreement, all of FS Malaysia’s obligations related to the Malaysian Facility Agreement are secured by a first party, first legal charge over the equipment financed by the credit facilities and the other documents, contracts and agreements related to that equipment. Also in connection with the Malaysian Facility Agreement, any payment claims of First Solar, Inc. against FS Malaysia are subordinated to the claims of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Malaysian Facility Agreement. The Malaysian Facility Agreement contains various financial covenants with which we must comply, such as debt to equity ratios, total leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and debt service coverage ratios. We must calculate and subsequently submit these ratios related to the financial covenants for the first time at the end of fiscal 2009. The Malaysian Facility Agreement also contains various customary non-financial covenants with which FS Malaysia must comply, including submitting various financial reports and business forecasts to the lenders, maintaining adequate insurance, complying with applicable laws and regulations, and restrictions on FS Malaysia’s ability to sell or encumber assets or make loan guarantees to third parties. We were in compliance with these covenants through September 26, 2009. Certain of our indebtedness bears interest at rates based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor). Euribor is the primary interbank lending rate within the Euro zone, with maturities ranging from one week to one year. A disruption of the credit environment could negatively impact interbank lending and therefore negatively impact the Euribor rate. An increase in the Euribor rate would increase our cost of borrowing. State of Ohio Loans During the years ended December 25, 2004 and December 31, 2005, we received the following loans from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio (in thousands): Outstanding at Original September 26, Ohio Borrowings Loan Amount Denomination Interest Maturity 2009 Director of Development of the State of Ohio $

First Solar Manufacturing GmbH repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of this credit facility and all accrued interest on June 30, 2009 and concurrently terminated this facility. "

In March 2009, the remaining balance of the term loan maturing in 2011 was paid off. (b) Partially amortizing with a balloon payment at maturity. (c) Collateralized by a note receivable of a wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group Capital. In May 2009, FPL Group sold $350 million of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a purchase contract issued by FPL Group and, initially, a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of a Series C Debenture due June 1, 2014 issued by FPL Group Capital (see table above). Total annual distributions on the equity units will be at the rate of 8.375%, consisting of interest on the debentures (3.60% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (4.775% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after December
160;1, 2011. Each stock purchase contract will require the holder to purchase FPL Group common stock for cash, which can be satisfied from proceeds raised from remarketing the FPL Group Capital debentures, based on a price per share range of $55.67 to $66.80 no later than the settlement date of June 1, 2012. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FPL Group. In 2008, FPL entered into a reclaimed water agreement with Palm Beach County, Florida (PBC) to provide FPL's West County Energy Center (WCEC) with reclaimed water for cooling purposes beginning in January 2011. Under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL is to constru
ct a reclaimed water system, including modifications to an existing treatment plant and a water pipeline, that PBC will legally own and operate. The reclaimed water agreement also requires PBC to issue bonds for the purpose of paying the costs associated with the construction of the reclaimed water system, including reimbursing FPL for costs it incurred prior to issuance of the bonds. In July 2009, PBC issued approximately $68 million principal amount of Palm Beach County, Florida Water and Sewer Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 with coupon rates ranging from 4.000% to 5.250% and maturity dates ranging from 2011 to 2040. Under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL will pay PBC an operating fee for the reclaimed water delivered which will be used by PBC to, among other things, service the principal of, and interest on, the bonds. The portion of the operating fee related to PBC's servicing principal of, and interest on, the bonds w
ill be paid by FPL annually as to principal and semi-annually as to interest, beginning October 2011, until final maturity of the bonds. FPL does not have a direct obligation to the bondholders; however, if FPL or PBC were to terminate the reclaimed water agreement, FPL would be obligated to continue to pay the portion of the operating fee intended to reimburse PBC for costs related to issuance of the bonds, including amounts to be used by PBC to service the principal of, and interest on, the bonds. In the event of a default by PBC under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL would have certain rights, including, among other things, the right to appoint a third party contractor to repair, and restore operations of, the reclaimed water treatment plant, and, in the event of a termination of the reclaimed water agreement by FPL relating to a PBC default, the right to assume ownership of the reclaimed water pipeline from PBC. For financial reporti

In March 2009, the remaining balance of the term loan maturing in 2011 was paid off. (b) Partially amortizing with a balloon payment at maturity. (c) Collateralized by a note receivable of a wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group Capital. In May 2009, FPL Group sold $350 million of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a purchase contract issued by FPL Group and, initially, a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of a Series C Debenture due June 1, 2014 issued by FPL Group Capital (see table above). Total annual distributions on the equity units will be at the rate of 8.375%, consisting of interest on the debentures (3.60% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (4.775% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after December
160;1, 2011. Each stock purchase contract will require the holder to purchase FPL Group common stock for cash, which can be satisfied from proceeds raised from remarketing the FPL Group Capital debentures, based on a price per share range of $55.67 to $66.80 no later than the settlement date of June 1, 2012. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FPL Group. In 2008, FPL entered into a reclaimed water agreement with Palm Beach County, Florida (PBC) to provide FPL's West County Energy Center (WCEC) with reclaimed water for cooling purposes beginning in January 2011. Under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL is to constru
ct a reclaimed water system, including modifications to an existing treatment plant and a water pipeline, that PBC will legally own and operate. The reclaimed water agreement also requires PBC to issue bonds for the purpose of paying the costs associated with the construction of the reclaimed water system, including reimbursing FPL for costs it incurred prior to issuance of the bonds. In July 2009, PBC issued approximately $68 million principal amount of Palm Beach County, Florida Water and Sewer Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 with coupon rates ranging from 4.000% to 5.250% and maturity dates ranging from 2011 to 2040. Under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL will pay PBC an operating fee for the reclaimed water delivered which will be used by PBC to, among other things, service the principal of, and interest on, the bonds. The portion of the operating fee related to PBC's servicing principal of, and interest on, the bonds w
ill be paid by FPL annually as to principal and semi-annually as to interest, beginning October 2011, until final maturity of the bonds. FPL does not have a direct obligation to the bondholders; however, if FPL or PBC were to terminate the reclaimed water agreement, FPL would be obligated to continue to pay the portion of the operating fee intended to reimburse PBC for costs related to issuance of the bonds, including amounts to be used by PBC to service the principal of, and interest on, the bonds. In the event of a default by PBC under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL would have certain rights, including, among other things, the right to appoint a third party contractor to repair, and restore operations of, the reclaimed water treatment plant, and, in the event of a termination of the reclaimed water agreement by FPL relating to a PBC default, the right to assume ownership of the reclaimed water pipeline from PBC. For financial reporti
ng purposes, FPL is considered the owner of the reclaimed water system and FPL and FPL Group are recording electric utility plant in service and other property as costs are incurred (approximately $12 million at September 30, 2009) and long-term debt as costs are eligible for reimbursement by PBC to FPL (approximately $12 million at September 30, 2009).

Beyond these items, there are no other restrictive covenants in the indentures. On June 2, 2009, the company commenced a tender offer for the maximum aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5.625% senior notes due 2012, the 5.375% senior notes due 2013, and the 5.375% senior notes due 2014 (collectively, the “Notes”) that it could purchase for $100.0 million at a purchase price per $1,000 principal amount determined in accordance with the procedures of a modified “Dutch Auction” (tender offer). The tender offer expired at midnight on June 29, 2009, and on June 30, 2009, $104.3 million of the Notes had been retired, generating a gross gain of $4.3 million upon the retirement of debt at a discount ($3.3 million net of related expenses and the write-off of remaining unamortized debt discount costs), which was recorded in other gains and losses, net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in the three months ended June 30, 2009. The fair market value of the company’s long term debt was determined by market quotes provided by Bloomberg. In the absence of an active market, the company relies upon the average price quoted by brokers for determining the fair market value of the debt. The level of trading, both in number of trades and amount of Notes traded, has increased to a level that the company believes to be a reasonable representation of the current fair market value of the Notes. Analysis of Borrowings by Maturity: $ in millions September 30, 2009 2009 294.2 2010 — 2011 — 2012 215.1 2013 333.5 Thereafter 197.1 Total long-term debt 1,039.9 On June 9, 2009, the company completed a new three-year $500.0 million revolving bank credit facility. The new credit facility replaced the $900.0 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire on March 31, 2010, but was terminated concurrent with the entry into the new credit facility. No early termination fees were incurred, and at the time of the termination, there were no loans outstanding under the prior credit facility. Amounts borrowed under the new credit facility are repayable at maturity on June 9, 2012, provided that such maturity date will automatically be accelerated to March 16, 2012, if 90% or more of the $300.0 million face amount of the company’s 5.625% senior notes due 2012, are not repaid, repurchased or defeased prior to March 16, 2012. Subject to certain conditions, the company has the right to increase the aggregate borrowings under the new credit facility up to $750.0 million. At September 30, 2009, there was no outstanding balance on the new credit facility expiring June 9, 2012. Borrowings under the new credit facility will bear interest at (i) LIBOR for specified interest periods or (ii) a floating base rate (based upon the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%), plus, in either case, an applicable margin determined with reference to the company’s credit ratings and specified credit default spreads. Based on credit ratings as of September 30, 2009, of the company and such credit default spreads, the applicable margin for LIBOR-based loans was 1.50% and for base rate loans was 0.50%. In addition, the company is required to pay the lenders a facility fee on the aggregate commitments of the lenders (whether or not used) at a rate per annum which is based on the company’s credit ratings. Based on credit ratings as of September 30, 2009, the annual facility fee was equal to 0.50%. The weighted average interest rate on the prior credit facility expiring March 31, 2010, was 4.06% at September 30, 2008. The credit agreement governing the new credit facility contains customary restrictive covenants on the company and its subsidiaries. Restrictive covenants in the credit agreement include, but are not limited to: prohibitions on creating, incurring or assuming any liens; making or holding external loans; entering into certain restrictive merger arrangements; selling, leasing, transferring or otherwise disposing of assets; making certain investments; making a material change in the nature of the business; making material amendments to organic documents; making a significant accounting policy change in certain situations; making or entering into restrictive agreements; becoming a general partner to certain investments; entering into transactions with affiliates; incurring certain indebtedness through the non-guarantor subsidiaries; and making certain restricted payments (with respect to equity and debt holders). Many of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00 through December 31, 2010, and not greater than 3.00:1.00 thereafter, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00, and (iii) maintenance on a monthly basis of consolidated long-term assets under management (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than $194.8 billion, which amount is subject to a one-time reset by the company under certain conditions. The credit agreement governing the new credit facility also contains customary provisions regarding events of default which could result in an acceleration or increase in amounts due, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, change of control, certain judgments, ERISA matters, cross-default to other debt agreements, governmental action prohibiting or restricting the company or its subsidiaries in a manner that has a material adverse effect and failure of certain guaranty obligations. The lenders (and their respective affiliates) may have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, cash management, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, leasing, foreign exchange, trust or other advisory services to the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. These parties may have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation for these services. "

4,2009-10-30,888228,XBRL," 4. Debt We classify our debt based on the contractual maturity dates of the underlying debt instruments or as of the earliest put date available to the holders of the applicable debt. As of September 30, 2009, our outstanding short-term debt was $155.6 million, and our outstanding long-term debt (excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements) was $10,247.4 million. 60;The weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings (both short-term and long-term) was approximately 4.35% during the third quarter of 2009 and approximately 5.30% during the third quarter of 2008. For the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings was approximately 4.66% and 5.46%, respectively. As of September 30, 2009, our outstanding short-term debt balance consisted of (i) $110 million in outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility (discussed below); (ii) $23.7 million in principal amount of tax-exempt bonds that mature on April 1, 2024, but are due on demand pursuant to certain standby purchase agreement provisions contained in the bond indenture (our subsidiary Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. “B” is the obligor on the bonds); (iii) a $9.8 million portion of a 5.40% long-term note payable (our subsidiaries Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. “A” and Kinder Morgan Canada Company are the obligors on the note); (iv) a $6.8 million portion of 5.23% senior notes (our subsidiary Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, L.P. is the obligor on the notes); and (v) $5.3 million in principal amount of adjustable rate industrial development revenue bonds that mature on January 1, 2010 (the bonds were issued by the Illinois Development Finance Authority and our subsidiary Arrow Terminals L.P. is the obligor on the bonds). Credit Facility Our $1.85 billion unsecured bank credit facility is with a syndicate of financial institutions, and Wachovia Bank, National Association is the administrative agent. The credit facility permits us to obtain bids for fixed rate loans from members of the lending syndicate, and the facility can be amended to allow for borrowings of up to $2.0 billion. Interest on our credit facility accrues at our option at a floating rate equal to either (i) the administrative agent’s base rate (but not less than the Federal F
unds Rate, plus 0.5%); or (ii) LIBOR, plus a margin, which varies depending upon the credit rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt. The outstanding balance under our credit facility was $110 million as of September 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility matures August 18, 2010 and currently, we plan to negotiate a renewal of the credit facility before its maturity date. Borrowings under our credit facility can be used for partnership purposes and as a backup for our commercial paper program. During the first quarter of 2009, following Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s filing for bankruptcy protection in September 2008, we amended the credit facility to remove Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank as a lender, thus reducing the borrowing capacity under the facility by $63.3 million. The commitments of the other banks remain unchanged, and the facility is not defaulted. Additionally, as of September 30, 2009, the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility was reduced by an aggregate amount of $264.2 million, consisting of (i) a $100 million letter of credit that supports certain proceedings with the California Public Utilities Commission involving refined products tariff charges on the intrastate common carrier operations of our Pacific operations’ pipelines in the state of California; (ii) a combined $90.8 million in three letters of credit that support tax-exempt bonds; (iii) a combined $35.0 million in two letters of credit that support our hedging of commodity price risks associated with the sale of natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil; (iv) a $21.4 million letter of credit that supports our indemnification obligations on the Series D note borrowings of Cortez Capital Corporation; and (v) a combined $17.0 million in other letters of credit supporting other obligations of us and our subsidiaries. Commercial Paper Program On October 13, 2008, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services lowered our short-term credit rating to A-3 from A-2. Additionally, on May 6, 2009, Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. downgraded our commercial paper rating to Prime-3 from Prime-2 and assigned a negative outlook to our long-term credit rating. As a result of these revisions and current commercial paper market conditions, we are currently unable to access commercial paper borrowings, and as of both September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had no commercial paper borrowings. However, we expect that our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through borrowings made under our bank credit facility described above. Senior Notes On February 1, 2009, we paid $250 million to retire the principal amount of our 6.30% senior notes that matured on that date. We borrowed the necessary funds under our bank credit facility. On May 14, 2009, we completed a public offering of senior notes. We issued a total of $1 billion in principal amount of senior notes in two separate series, consisting of $300 million of 5.625% notes due February 15, 2015, and $700 million of 6.85% notes due February 15, 2020. We received proceeds from the issuance of the notes, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $993.3 million, and we used the proceeds to reduce the borrow
ings under our bank credit facility. On September 16, 2009, we completed an additional public offering of senior notes. We issued a total of $1 billion in principal amount of senior notes in two separate series, consisting of $400 million of 5.80% notes due March 1, 2021, and $600 million of 6.50% notes due September 1, 2039. We received proceeds from the issuance of the notes, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $987.4 million, and we used the proceeds to reduce the borrowings under our bank credit facility. Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. “A” Debt Effective January 1, 2007, we acquired the remaining approximately 50.2% interest in the Cochin pipeline system that we did not already own. As part of our purchase price consideration, two of our subsidiaries issued a long-term note payable to the seller having a fair value of $42.3 million. We valued the debt equal to the present value of amounts to be paid, determined using an annual interest rate of 5.40%. 60;Our subsidiaries Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. “A” and Kinder Morgan Canada Company are the obligors on the note, and the principal amount of the note, along with interest, is due in five annual installments of $10.0 million beginning March 31, 2008. The final payment is due March 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2008, the net present value (representing the outstanding balance on our balance sheet) of the note was $36.6 million. We paid the second installment on March 31, 2009, and as of September 30, 2009, the net present value of the note was $27.8 million. Interest Rate Swaps &
lt;br /> Information on our interest rate swaps is contained in Note 6 ""Risk Mangement—Interest Rate Risk Management."" Contingent Debt Our contingent debt disclosu
res pertain to certain types of guarantees or indemnifications we have made and cover certain types of guarantees included within debt agreements, even if the likelihood of requiring our performance under such guarantee is remote. The following is a description of our contingent debt agreements as of September 30, 2009. Cortez Pipeline Company Debt Pursuant to a certain Throu
ghput and Deficiency Agreement, the partners of Cortez Pipeline Company (Kinder Morgan CO2 Company, L.P. – 50% partner; a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation – 37% partner; and Cortez Vickers Pipeline Company – 13% partner) are required, on a several, proportional percentage ownership basis, to contribute capital to Cortez Pipeline Company in the event of a cash deficiency. Furthermore, due to our indirect ownership of Cortez Pipeline Company through Kinder Morgan CO2 Company, L.P., we severally guarantee 50% of the debt of Cortez Capital Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cortez Pipeline Company. As of September 30, 2009, the debt facilities of Cortez Capital Corporation consisted of (i) $42.9 million of Series D notes due May 15, 2013; (ii) a $125 million short-term commercial paper program; and (iii) a $125 million committed revolving credit facility due December 22, 2009 (to support the above-mentioned $125 million commercial paper program). Cortez is currently in the process of refinancing the $125 million credit facility and it expects to close on this refinancing in the fourth quarter of 2009. As of September 30, 2009, in addition to the $42.9 million of outstanding Series D notes, Cortez Capital Corporation had outstanding borrowings of $109.5 million under its credit facility. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2009, our contingent share of Cortez’s debt was $76.2 million (50% of total guaranteed borrowings). With respect to Cortez’s Series D notes, the average interest rate on the notes is 7.14%, and the outstanding $42.9 million principal amount of the notes is due in four equal annual installments of approximately $10.7 million beginning May 2010. Shell Oil Company shares our several guaranty obligations jointly and severally; however, we are obligated to indemnify Shell for liabilities it incurs in connection with such guaranty. As of September 30, 2009, JP Morgan Chase has issued a letter of credit on our behalf in the amount of $21.4 million to secure our indemnification obligations to Shell for 50% of the $42.9 million in principal amount of Series D notes outstanding as of that date.&lt
;/div> Nassau County, Florida Ocean Highway and Port Authority Debt We have posted a letter of credit as security for borrowings under Adjustable Demand Revenue Bonds issued by the Nassau County, Florida Ocean Highway and Port Authority. The bonds were issued for the purpose of constructing certain port improvements located in Fernandino Beach, Nassau County, Florida. Our subsid
iary, Nassau Terminals LLC is the operator of the marine port facilities. The bond indenture is for 30 years and allows the bonds to remain outstanding until December 1, 2020. Principal payments on the bonds are made on the first of December each year and corresponding reductions are made to the letter of credit. As of September 30, 2009, this letter of credit had a face amount of $21.2 million. Rockies Express Pipeline LLC Debt Pursuant to certain guaranty agreements, all three member owners of West2East Pipeline LLC (which owns all of the member interests in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC) have agreed to guarantee, severally in the same proportion as their percentage ownership of the member interests in West2East Pipeline LLC, borrowings under Rockies Express’ $2.0 billion five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (due April 28, 2011) and Rockies Express’ $2.0 billion commercial paper program. The three member owners and their respective ownership interests consist of the following: our subsidiary Kinder Morgan W2E Pipeline LLC – 51%, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy – 25%, and a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips – 24%. Borrowings under the Rockies Express commercial paper program and/or its credit facility are primarily used to finance the construction of the Rockies Express interstate natural gas pipeline and to pay related expenses. The credit facility, which can be amended to allow for borrowings of up to $2.5 billion, supports borrowings under the commercial paper program, and borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the borrowings allowed under the credit facility. Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank was a lending bank with a $41 million commitment under Rockies Express Pipeline LLC’s $2.0 billion credit facility, and during the first quarter of 2009, Rockies Express amended its facility to remove Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank as a lender, thus reducing the borrowing capacity under the facility by $41.0 million. However, the commitments of the other banks remain unchanged, and the facility is not defaulted. In October 2008, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services lowered Rockies Express’ short-term credit rating to A-3 from A-2. As a result of this revision and current commercial paper market conditions, Rockies Express is unable to access commercial paper borrowings; however, it expects that its financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through both borrowings made under its long-term bank credit facility and contributions by its equity investors. As of September 30, 2009, Rockies Express had outstanding borrowings of $1,8
71.5 million under its credit facility. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2009, our contingent share of Rockies Express’ debt was $954.5 million (51% of total guaranteed borrowings). Additionally, on August 20, 2009, Rockies Express paid $600 million to retire the principal amount of its floating rate senior notes that matured on that date. It obtained the necessary funds to repay these senior notes from contributions received from its equity investors, including $306.0 million received from us (51% of total principal repayments). Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC Debt Pursuant to certain guaranty agreements, each of the two member owners of Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC have agreed to guarantee, severally in the same proportion as their percentage ownership of the member interests in Midcontinent Express, borrowings under its $1.4 billion three-year, unsecured revolving credit facility, entered into on February 29, 2008 and due February 28, 2011. The facility is with a syndicate of financial institutions with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as the administrative agent. Borrowings under the credit facility are used to finance the construction of the Midcontinent Express pipeline system and to pay related expenses. Midcontinent Express is an equity method investee of ours, and the two member owners and their respective ownership interests consist of the following: our subsidiary Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. “A” – 50%, and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. – 50%. Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank was a lending bank with a $100 million commitment to the Midcontinent Express $1.4 billion credit facility, and following Le
hman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy filing (discussed above), Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank has not met its obligations to lend under the credit facility, effectively reducing borrowing capacity under this facility by $100 million. The commitments of the other banks remain unchanged and the facility is not defaulted. As of September 30, 2009, Midcontinent Express had outstanding borrowings of $371.6 million under its three-year credit facility. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2009, our contingent share of Midcontinent Express’ debt was $185.8 million (50% of total borrowings). Furthermore, the credit facility can be used for the issuance of letters of credit to support the construction of the Midcontinent Express pipeline system, and as of September 30, 2009, a letter of credit having a face amount of $33.3 million was issued under the credit facility. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2009, our contingent responsibility with regard to this outstanding letter of credit was $16.7 million (50% of total face amount). In October 2009, Midcontinent Express reduced the capacity on its credit facility from $1.4 billion to $275 million after completing the permanent long-term financing discussed below. On September 16, 2009, Mid
continent Express completed a private offering of senior notes. It issued an aggregate of $800 million in principal amount of fixed rate senior notesunder an indenture between itself and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, but instead was subject to the requirements of Rule 144A under the Act. Midcontinent Express received net proceeds of $793.9 million from this offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses, and the net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The indentu
re provided for the issuance of two separate series of notes, as follows (i) $350 million in principal amount of 5.45% senior notes due September 15, 2014; and (ii) $450 million in principal amount of 6.70% senior notes due September 15, 2019. Interest on the notes will be paid semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2010.

3,600,533 Prior to January 1, 2009, separate accounting for the embedded conversion option in our convertible long-term debt was not required when the conversion spread feature did not qualify to be accounted for as a derivative instrument. Effective January 1, 2009, we account for our convertible debt instruments with a liability component based on the fair value of a similar nonconvertible debt instrument and an equity component based on the excess of the initial proceeds from the convertible debt instrument over the liability component. Such excess represents proceeds related to the conversion option and is recorded as capital in excess of par value. The liability is recorded at a discount, which is then amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the convertible debt instrument’s expected life. We have accounted for our convertible debt instruments on a retrospective basis to all past periods presented for all convertible debt instruments required to be accounted for in this manner. Both our $2.75 billion 0.94% senior exchangeable notes issued May 2006 and our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes issued June 2003 have been presented in this manner. The following assumptions were made in our accounting change: $700 million zero coupon senior $2.75 billion 0.94% senior Assumptions exchangeable notes exchangeable notes Date of issue June 2003 May 2006 Expected maturity date June 2008 May 2011 Amortization period 5 years 5 years Nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 2.8

% Conversion Triggers $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes In May 2008 Nabors Delaware called for redemption of all of its $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due 2023. The total amount paid to effect the redemption and related exchange was $700 million in cash and the issuance of approximately 5.25 million of our common shares with a fair value of $249.8 million, the price equal to the principal amount of the notes plus the excess of the exchange value of the notes over their principal amount. $2.75 billion 0.94% senior exchangeable notes (1) The notes are exchangeable into cash and, if applicable, Nabors common shares based on an exchange rate of the equivalent value of 21.8221 Nabors common shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equal to an initial exchange price of approximately $45.83 per share), subject to adjustment during the 30 calendar days ending at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. The number of shares that we would be required to issue upon exchange consists only of the incremental shares that would be issued above the principal amount of the notes, as we are required to pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes exchanged. There would be an if-converted value in excess of the principal amount of the notes only when the price of our shares exceeds $45.83 as of the last trading day of the quarter and the average price of our shares for the ten consecutive trading days beginning on the third business day after the last trading day of the quarter exceeds $45.83. (1) Nabors Delaware entered into exchangeable note hedge transactions with respect to our common shares. The call options are designed to cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the net number of our common shares that would be deliverable to exchanging noteholders in the event of an exchange of the notes. Nabors Delaware paid an aggregate amount of approximately $583.6 million of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to acquire the call options. Nabors also entered into separate warrant transactions at the time of the sale of the notes whereby we sold warrants which give the holders the right to acquire approximately 60.0 million of our common shares at a strike price of $54.64 per share. On exercise of the warrants, we have the option to deliver cash or our common shares equal to the difference between the then market price and strike price. All of the warrants will be exercisable and will expire on August 15, 2011. We received aggregate proceeds of approximately $421.2 million from the sale of the warrants and used $353.4 million of the proceeds to purchase 10.0 million of Nabors’ common shares. The purchased call options and sold warrants are separate contracts entered into by Nabors and Nabors Delaware with two financial institutions and are not part of the terms of the notes and will not affect the holders’ rights under the notes. The purchased call options are expected to offset the potential dilution upon exchange of the notes in the event that the market value per share of our common shares at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the purchased call options, which corresponds to the initial exchange price of the notes and is simultaneously subject to certain customary adjustments. The warrants will effectively increase the exchange price of the notes to $54.64 per share of our common shares, from the perspective of Nabors, representing a 55% premium based on the last reported bid price of $35.25 per share on May 17, 2006. We recorded the exchangeable note hedge and warrants in capital in excess of par value as of the transaction date, and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value.

113,129 During 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 we purchased $888.5 million par value of our $2.75 billion 0.94% senior exchangeable notes in the open market, leaving approximately $1.86 billion par value outstanding. On January 12, 2009, Nabors Delaware completed a private placement of $1.125 billion aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior notes due 2019 with registration rights, which are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us. The issue of senior notes was resold by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to certain investors outside of the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act. The senior notes bear interest at a rate of 9.25% per year, payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2009. The senior notes will mature on January 15, 2019. The senior notes are unsecured and are junior in right of payment to any of Nabors Delaware’s future secured debt. The senior notes rank equally with any of Nabors Delaware’s other existing and future unsubordinated debt and are senior in right of payment to any of Nabors Delaware’s future senior subordinated debt. Our guarantee of the senior notes is unsecured and ranks equal in right of payment to all of our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The senior notes are subject to redemption by Nabors Delaware, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes then outstanding to be redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, determined in the manner set forth in the indenture. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined in the indenture, the holders of senior notes may require Nabors Delaware to purchase all or any part of each senior note in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, except to the extent Nabors Delaware has exercised its right to redeem the senior notes. Nabors Delaware is using the proceeds of the offering of the senior notes for the repayment or repurchase of indebtedness and general corporate purposes. On March 30, 2009, we and Nabors Delaware filed a registration statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act. The registration statement related to the exchange offer to noteholders required under the registration rights agreement related to the $1.125 billion senior notes. On May 11, 2009 the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. On July 23, 2009 Nabors Delaware issued $1,069,392,000 registered 9.25% senior notes due 2019 in exchange for an equal amount of its unregistered 9.25% senior notes due 2019 that were properly tendered. On August 17, 2009, we paid $168.4 million to discharge the remaining balance of our $225 million 4.875% senior notes. "

September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. (2) As of
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, no revolving
loans were drawn under the credit facility; however, the principal
amount of letter of credit obligations totaled $20.0 million and
$21.5 million, respectively, reducing available borrowing capacity
to $580.0 million and $578.5 million, respectively. The terms
of the private placement senior notes and the credit facility each
contain customary covenants that require compliance with certain
financial covenants based on: (1) debt to earnings ratio and
(2) interest coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the financial
covenants in both the note purchase agreement and the credit
agreement.
Effective
October 29, 2009, we amended the terms of our $800 million
credit facility. The amendment results in, among other
things, improved borrowing flexibility, the addition of
multi-currency letters of credit, and more liberally defined
financial covenants and debt restrictions. An increase in annual
LIBOR margin of 50 basis points resulted from this amendment. Refer
to NOTE 20 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS for further
information.
Short-term
Facilities
On
February 9, 2009, Asia Pacific Iron Ore amended its A$40
million ($34.9 million) multi-option facility. The original
facility provided credit for short-term working capital and
contingent instruments, such as performance bonds. The amended
facility included an additional A$80 million ($69.8 million) cash
facility, which expired on August 31, 2009. The outstanding
bank commitments on the remaining A$40 million multi-option
facility totaled A$35.7 million ($31.2 million) and A$27.2 million
($18.8 million) in performance bonds, reducing borrowing capacity
to A$4.3 million ($3.7 million) and A$12.8 million ($8.8 million)
at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The
facility agreement contains financial covenants as follows:
(1) debt to earnings ratio and (2) interest coverage
ratio. As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we
were in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit
facility agreement. We have provided a guarantee of the facility,
along with certain of our Australian subsidiaries.
Latin America
At
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, Amapá had
total project debt outstanding of approximately $553 million and
$493 million, respectively, for which we have provided a several
guarantee on our 30 percent share. Our estimate of the aggregate
fair value of the outstanding guarantee is $6.7 million as of
September 30, 2009, which is reflected in Other
Liabilities on the Statements of Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Position. On October 1, 2009, $20.9
million of short-term debt was repaid, reducing the total project
debt outstanding to approximately $532 million. Amapá is
currently in violation of certain operating and financial loan
covenants contained in the debt agreements. However, Amapá and
its lenders have agreed to suspend these covenants through
November 8, 2009 related to the remaining debt outstanding. If
Amapá is unable to either renegotiate the terms of the debt
agreements or obtain further extension of the compliance waivers,
violation of the operating and financial loan covenants may result
in the lenders calling the debt, thereby requiring us to recognize
and repay our share of the debt in accordance with the provisions
of the guarantee arrangement.

The subsidiary has pledged these assets to secure loans from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution. The subsidiary's borrowing costs under the credit facility vary based on the commercial paper conduit's actual cost to issue commercial paper that supports the debt. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, $228 million and $76 million of accounts receivable and $136 million and $170 million of unbilled revenue were pledged by the subsidiary under the credit agreement related to PPL Electric's and the subsidiary's participation in the asset-backed commercial paper program. Based on the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue pledged, $150 million was available for borrowing at September 30, 2009.

Financing Activities (PPL) In March 2009, PPL Capital Funding retired the entire $201 million of its 4.33% Notes Exchange Series A upon maturity. (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) In March 2009, PPL Energy Supply completed tender offers to purchase up to $250 million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding senior notes in order to reduce future interest expense. Pursuant to the offers, PPL Energy Supply purchased approximately $100 mi
llion aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Senior Notes due 2036 for $77 million, plus accrued interest, and approximately $150 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.20% Senior Notes due 2016 for $143 million, plus accrued interest. In connection with the extinguishment of these notes, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a net gain of $25 million, which is reflected in ""Other Income - net"" on the Statement of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. PPL recorded an additional net gain of $4 million in ""Other Income - net"" as a result of reclassifying gains and losses on related cash flow hedges from AOCI into earnings. In April 2009, the P
EDFA issued $231 million aggregate principal amount of Exempt Facilities Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2009A and 2009B due 2038 and Series 2009C due 2037 (PPL Energy Supply, LLC Project), on behalf of PPL Energy Supply. The Series 2009A bonds, in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million, and the Series 2009B bonds, in an aggregate principal amount of $50 million, were issued by the PEDFA in order to refund $150 million aggregate principal amount of Exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2008A and 2008B (PPL Energy Supply, LLC Project) due 2038 that were issued by the PEDFA in December 2008 on behalf of PPL Energy Supply, and for which PPL Investment Corp. acted as initial purchaser. The Series 2009C bonds, in an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, were issued in order to refund $81 million aggregate principal amount of Exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2007 (PPL Energy Supply, LLC Project) due 2037 that were issued by the PEDFA in Decembe
r 2007 on behalf of PPL Energy Supply. Among other things, the completed refundings were able to take advantage of provisions in the Economic Stimulus Package that eliminated the application of the AMT to interest payable on the refinanced indebtedness. The refundings of the bonds were effected by the ultimate distribution of $231 million by the PEDFA to the bond holders, including PPL Investment Corp. As a result of the refundings of the bonds, PPL Investment Corp. received proceeds of $150 million, which is reflected as a cash flow from investing activities on the Statement of Cash Flows for PPL and PPL Energy Supply for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The Series 2009A, 2009B and 2009C bonds are structured as variable-rate remarketable bonds. PPL Energy Supply may convert the interest rate mode on the bonds from time to time to a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate or a term rate of at least one year. The bonds are subject to mandatory purchase under certain circumstances, including upon conversion to a different interest rate mode, and are subject to mandatory redemption upon a determination that the interest on the bonds would be included in the holders' gross income for federal tax purposes. The Series 2009A bonds bore interest at an initial rate of 0.90% through June 30, 2009. The Series 2009B bonds bore interest at an initial rate of 1.25% through September 30, 2009. The Series 2009C bonds are in a weekly interest rate mode, bearing interest at 0.30% at September 30, 2009. PPL Energy Supply elected to change the interest rate mode on the Series 2009A and Series 2009B bonds to a commercial paper rate mode upon expiration of the initial rate period for each series. The Series 2009A bonds were remarketed in a commercial paper rate mode in July 2009 and bear interest at 0.90% through December 9, 2009. The Series 2009B bonds were remarketed in a commercial paper rate mode in October 2009 and bear interest at 0.50% through March 31, 2010. At the end of each commercial paper rate period, the bonds will be remarketed based upon an interest rate mode elected by PPL Energy Supply. In connection with the issuance of each series of bonds by the PEDFA, PPL Energy Supply entered into separate loan agreements with the PEDFA pursuant to which the PEDFA loaned to PPL Energy Supply the proceeds of the Series 2009A, Series 2009B and Series 2009C bonds on payment terms that correspond to those of the bonds. PPL Energy Supply issued separate promissory notes to the PEDFA to evidence its obligations under each of the loan agreements. These loan agreements and promissory notes replaced those associated with the refunded 2007 and 2008 PEDFA bonds in a non-cash transaction that is excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows. Separate letters of credit were issued under PPL Energy Supply's $3.2 billion five-year syndicated credit facility to the trustee in support of each series of bonds. The letters of credit permit the trustee to draw amounts to pay principal of and interest on, and the purchase price of, the Series 2009A, Series 2009B and Series 2009C bonds when due. PPL Energy Supply is required to reimburse any draws on the letters of credit within one business day of such draw. (PPL a
nd PPL Electric) In May 2009, PPL Electric issued $300 million of 6.25% First Mortgage Bonds due 2039 (6.25% Bonds). The 6.25% Bonds may be redeemed any time prior to maturity at PPL Electric's option at make-whole redemption prices. PPL Electric received proceeds of $296 million, net of a discount and underwriting fees, from the issuance of the 6.25% Bonds. Approximately $86 million of the proceeds were used in August 2009 to partially fund the repayment at maturity of $486 million aggregate principal amount of PPL Electric's Senior Secured Bonds, 6-1/4% Series. The balance of such repayment was funded from the issuance in Octobe
r 2008 of $400 million of 7.125% Senior Secured Bonds due 2013. The balance of the proceeds from the issuance of the 6.25% Bonds was used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures. In June 2009, PPL Electric repaid its $9 million obligation under a Variable Rate Pollution Control Facilities Note in connection with the early redemption in full of the underlying pollution control revenue bonds that were issued by the Indiana County Industrial Development Authority and due in June 2027. Distributions and Capital Contributions (PPL) In February 2009, PPL announced an increase to its quarterly common stock dividend, effective April 1, 2009, to 34.5 cents per share (equivalent to $1.38 per annum). Future div
idends, declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will be dependent upon future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other factors. (PPL Energy Supply) During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, PPL Energy Supply distributed $487 million to its parent company, PPL Energy Funding, and received cash capital contributions of $50 million. (PPL Electric) During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, PPL Electric paid common stock dividends of $206 million to PPL. "

The subsidiary has pledged these assets to secure loans from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution. The subsidiary's borrowing costs under the credit facility vary based on the commercial paper conduit's actual cost to issue commercial paper that supports the debt. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, $228 million and $76 million of accounts receivable and $136 million and $170 million of unbilled revenue were pledged by the subsidiary under the credit agreement related to PPL Electric's and the subsidiary's participation in the asset-backed commercial paper program. Based on the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue pledged, $150 million was available for borrowing at September 30, 2009. PPL Electric's sale to its subsidiary of the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue is an absolute sale of the assets, and PPL Electric does not retain an interest in these assets. However, for financial reporting purposes, the subsidiary's financial results are consolidated in PPL Electric's financial statemen

Financing Activities (PPL) In March 2009, PPL Capital Funding retired the entire $201 million of its 4.33% Notes Exchange Series A upon maturity. (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) In March 2009, PPL Energy Supply completed tender offers to purchase up to $250 million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding senior notes in order to reduce future interest expense. Pursuant to the offers, PPL Energy Supply purchased approximately $100 mi
llion aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Senior Notes due 2036 for $77 million, plus accrued interest, and approximately $150 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.20% Senior Notes due 2016 for $143 million, plus accrued interest. In connection with the extinguishment of these notes, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a net gain of $25 million, which is reflected in ""Other Income - net"" on the Statement of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. PPL recorded an additional net gain of $4 million in ""Other Income - net"" as a result of reclassifying gains and losses on related cash flow hedges from AOCI into earnings. In April 2009, the P
EDFA issued $231 million aggregate principal amount of Exempt Facilities Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2009A and 2009B due 2038 and Series 2009C due 2037 (PPL Energy Supply, LLC Project), on behalf of PPL Energy Supply. The Series 2009A bonds, in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million, and the Series 2009B bonds, in an aggregate principal amount of $50 million, were issued by the PEDFA in order to refund $150 million aggregate principal amount of Exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2008A and 2008B (PPL Energy Supply, LLC Project) due 2038 that were issued by the PEDFA in December 2008 on behalf of PPL Energy Supply, and for which PPL Investment Corp. acted as initial purchaser. The Series 2009C bonds, in an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, were issued in order to refund $81 million aggregate principal amount of Exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2007 (PPL Energy Supply, LLC Project) due 2037 that were issued by the PEDFA in Decembe
r 2007 on behalf of PPL Energy Supply. Among other things, the completed refundings were able to take advantage of provisions in the Economic Stimulus Package that eliminated the application of the AMT to interest payable on the refinanced indebtedness. The refundings of the bonds were effected by the ultimate distribution of $231 million by the PEDFA to the bond holders, including PPL Investment Corp. As a result of the refundings of the bonds, PPL Investment Corp. received proceeds of $150 million, which is reflected as a cash flow from investing activities on the Statement of Cash Flows for PPL and PPL Energy Supply for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The Series 2009A, 2009B and 2009C bonds are structured as variable-rate remarketable bonds. PPL Energy Supply may convert the interest rate mode on the bonds from time to time to a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate or a term rate of at least one year. The bonds are subject to mandatory purchase under certain circumstances, including upon conversion to a different interest rate mode, and are subject to mandatory redemption upon a determination that the interest on the bonds would be included in the holders' gross income for federal tax purposes. The Series 2009A bonds bore interest at an initial rate of 0.90% through June 30, 2009. The Series 2009B bonds bore interest at an initial rate of 1.25% through September 30, 2009. The Series 2009C bonds are in a weekly interest rate mode, bearing interest at 0.30% at September 30, 2009. PPL Energy Supply elected to change the interest rate mode on the Series 2009A and Series 2009B bonds to a commercial paper rate mode upon expiration of the initial rate period for each series. The Series 2009A bonds were remarketed in a commercial paper rate mode in July 2009 and bear interest at 0.90% through December 9, 2009. The Series 2009B bonds were remarketed in a commercial paper rate mode in October 2009 and bear interest at 0.50% through March 31, 2010. At the end of each commercial paper rate period, the bonds will be remarketed based upon an interest rate mode elected by PPL Energy Supply. In connection with the issuance of each series of bonds by the PEDFA, PPL Energy Supply entered into separate loan agreements with the PEDFA pursuant to which the PEDFA loaned to PPL Energy Supply the proceeds of the Series 2009A, Series 2009B and Series 2009C bonds on payment terms that correspond to those of the bonds. PPL Energy Supply issued separate promissory notes to the PEDFA to evidence its obligations under each of the loan agreements. These loan agreements and promissory notes replaced those associated with the refunded 2007 and 2008 PEDFA bonds in a non-cash transaction that is excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows. Separate letters of credit were issued under PPL Energy Supply's $3.2 billion five-year syndicated credit facility to the trustee in support of each series of bonds. The letters of credit permit the trustee to draw amounts to pay principal of and interest on, and the purchase price of, the Series 2009A, Series 2009B and Series 2009C bonds when due. PPL Energy Supply is required to reimburse any draws on the letters of credit within one business day of such draw. (PPL a

The Convertible Notes are convertible only under the following certain circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after June 30, 2009 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter, (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day measurement period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each day in the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate, (3) if specified distributions to holders of our common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, or (4) at any time on or after February 19, 2013. As of October 3, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the Convertible Notes had been satisfied. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes totaled approximately $582 million after deducting discounts, commissions and expenses. The Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to separately account for the liability (debt) and the equity (conversion option) components of the Convertible Notes in a manner that reflects our non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, we recorded a debt discount and corresponding increase to additional paid in capital of approximately $135 million as of the date of issuance. We are amortizing the debt discount utilizing the effective interest method over the life of the Convertible Notes which increases the effective interest rate of the Convertible Notes from its coupon rate of 4.50% to 11.72%. Transaction costs of $18 million were proportionately allocated between the liability and equity components. Concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with two counterparties, including an underwriter and an affiliate of an underwriter, of the Convertible Notes, for purposes of reducing the potential dilutive effect upon the conversion. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions is $13.125 per share of our common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes) and is subject to certain customary adjustments. The convertible note hedge transactions cover 45,714,300 shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. We may settle the convertible note hedge transactions in shares, cash or a combination of cash and shares, at our option. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $140 million, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Separately and concurrently with entering into these hedge transactions, we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, an aggregate of 45,714,300 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $15.75 per share. The aggregate proceeds from the warrant transactions were $95 million, which was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. We incurred cash and non-cash interest expense of $14 million and $24 million for these Convertible Notes for the three and nine months ended October 3, 2009. As of October 3, 2009, the unamortized discount amount, including issuance costs totaled $137 million, resulting in a net carrying value of $463 million for the liability component. Credit facility On July 14, 2009, a newly formed, wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Textron entered into a credit agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States which establishes a $500 million credit facility to provide funding to finance purchases of aircraft by non-U.S. buyers from Cessna and Bell. The facility is structured to be available for financing sales to international customers who take delivery of new aircraft by December 2010. At October 3, 2009, we had $30 million outstanding under this facility. "

The term loan due in
December 2009 (“Term Loan”) was paid and financed with
the issuance of the 6.500% notes due 2014 (“2014
Notes”) on February 26, 2009. (b)
At September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the Company held interest rate swaps
related to the 5.400% notes due 2011 (“2011 Notes”)
with an aggregate notional amount of $750 million and $550 million,
respectively. During 2008, the Company terminated an aggregate
notional amount of $195 million of interest rate swaps. The Company
received cash, excluding interest, of $10.7 million on the
termination of these swaps, the offset of which is reflected in
“Borrowings” and will be reclassified as a reduction to
“Interest expense” over the life of the 2011
Notes. (c)
The 2014 Notes were issued
on February 26, 2009 and the proceeds were used to redeem the
Term Loan. (d)
At December 31, 2008,
the Company held an interest rate swap related to the 5.930% notes
due 2016 (“2016 Notes”) with an aggregate notional
amount of $110 million. During the first quarter of 2009, the
Company terminated the swap. The Company received cash, excluding
interest, of $14.6 million on the termination of this swap, the
offset of which is reflected in “Borrowings” and will
be reclassified as a reduction to “Interest expense”
over the life of the 2016 Notes. For further information regarding
the interest rate swap, refer to Note 12,
“Derivatives.” (e)
At December 31, 2008,
the fair value of commercial paper approximated its carrying value
due to the short term nature of the obligations. The fair value of
the Term Loan approximated its carrying value as it was a variable
rate loan and Western Union credit spreads did not move
significantly between the date of the borrowing (December 5, 2008)
and December 31, 2008. The fair value of the fixed rate notes
is determined by obtaining quotes from multiple independent banks
and excludes the impact of discounts and related interest rate
swaps. Exclusive of
discounts and the fair value of the interest rate swaps, maturities
of borrowings as of September 30, 2009 are $1.0 billion in
2011, $500 million in 2014 and $1.5 billion thereafter. The
Company’s obligations with respect to its outstanding
borrowings as described above rank equally. 2014
Notes On
February 26, 2009, the Company issued $500 million of
aggregate principal amount of 2014 Notes to repay the balance of
the Term Loan which was scheduled to mature in December 2009.
Interest with respect to the 2014 Notes is payable semiannually on
February 26 and August 26 each year based on the fixed
per annum interest rate of 6.500%. The 2014 Notes contain covenants
that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the
Company and certain of its subsidiaries to grant certain types of
security interests or enter into sale and leaseback transactions.
The Company may redeem the 2014 Notes at any time prior to maturity
at the greater of par or the applicable make whole
premium.

Note 18: Borrowings We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2009 were approximately $610 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of September 26, 2009. In 2005, we issued $1.6 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2005 debentures) due in 2035. During the third quarter of 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2009 debentures) due in 2039. Both the 2005 and 2009 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. We capitalized all interest associated with these debentures during the periods presented. 2005 Debentures 2009 Debentures Coupon interest rate 2.95

% 1 The effective rate is based on the rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. 2 Both the 2005 and 2009 debentures have a contingent interest component that will require us to pay interest based on certain thresholds and for certain events commencing on December 15, 2010 and August 1, 2019, for the 2005 and 2009 debentures, respectively, as outlined in the indentures governing the 2005 and 2009 debentures. The fair value of the related embedded derivative was $27 million and $16 million as of September 26, 2009 for the 2005 and 2009 debentures, respectively ($36 million as of December 27, 2008 for the 2005 debentures). Both the 2005 and 2009 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. We can settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. However, we will settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. On or after December 15, 2012, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2005 and 2009 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holder’s debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Both the 2005 and 2009 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to our existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We concluded that both the 2005 and 2009 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders’ equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivatives. 2005 Debentures 2009 Debentures Sept. 26, Dec. 27, Sept. 26, (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2009 2008 2009 Outstanding Principal $

22.68 1 The remaining amortization periods for the 2005 and 2009 debentures are approximately 26 and 30 years, respectively, as of September 26, 2009. 2 The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2005 and 2009 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of 10 cents and 14 cents per share, for the 2005 and 2009 debentures, respectively, but does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of either the 2005 or 2009 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel, as described in the indentures governing the 2005 and 2009 debentures.

3,2009-11-02,882835,XBRL," 9. Debt In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. The notes were issued at 99.978% of their principal amount. The net proceeds were used to pay off our $350 million term loan due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our $1.1 billion credit facility. We recorded a $0.4 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate o
f 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our e
xisting and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Our 3.75% senior subordinated convertible notes due 2034 became convertible on January 15, 2009 at the option of the holders of the notes at a price of $395.02 per note. After this date, the note price increases as interest accrues at the stated rate of 3.75%. We may only pay cash up to the value of the accreted principal, and at our option, any combination of cash and common stock upon conversion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, approximately 50% of the notes were converted for $116.2 million in cash and 963,100 shares of common stock at a weighted average share price of $43.47. No gain or loss was recorded upon these conversions. In addition, a related $8.1 million deferred tax liability associated with excess deductions recorded for tax purposes was relieved to additional paid in capital upon the conversions. We are required to separately account f
or the liability and equity components of our 3.75% senior subordinated convertible notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. The debt discount became fully amortized on January 15, 2009, the first date that holders of the notes could exercise their put option and we could exercise our call option, and was $0.3 million at December 31, 2008. Interest expense related to the notes was as follows (in thousands): Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Contractual (stated) interest $ 1,114 $ 2,156 $ 3,800 $&lt

;#160; $ 11,777 At September 30, 2009, the conversion price on the outstanding notes was $405.53. If converted at September 30, 2009, the value would exceed the $117.6 million principal amount of the notes by approximately $59 million and would result in the issuance of 1,209,150 shares of our common stock. On September 30, 2009, the conversion of 13,060 notes was pending, with a settlement date of October 15, 2009. The conversion resulted in the payment of $5.3 million in cash and the issuance of 54,450 shares of common stock at a share price of $50.66. Our long-term debt at September 30, 2009 included $1.0 billion of fixed-rate notes with fair values as follows: <

In October 2009, we entered into three variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire August 2013, effectively converting our $500 million senior notes due 2013 into variable rate debt. The variable interest rate is calculated on a weighted-average spread of 4.377% plus the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). These agreements are intended to rebalance our ratio of variable to fixed rate debt. "

7,2009-11-03,918160,XBRL," NOTE 6 – Long-term Debt During the first half of 2009, the Company repurchased a portion of its 7 3/4% senior notes due in 2012. In connection with these repurchases, the Company recorded non-cash, pre-tax gains in amounts which have been previously reported. The Company did not make any repurchases in the third quarter of 2009. Total repurchases for the first nine months of 2009 were $26.4 with cash payments of $22.8 and non-cash, pre-tax gains of approximately $3.6, resulting in an outstanding balance of $504.0 at September 30, 2009 for the remaining senior notes. The repurchases were funded from the Company’s existing cash balances. The Company from time to time may continue to make cash repurchases of its outstanding senior notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend upon whether any senior notes are offered to the Company by the holders, prevailing market conditions, the Company’s cash and liquidity position and needs, and other relevant factors. The amounts involved in the repurchases may or may not be material. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments does not differ materially from their estimated fair value at September 30, 2009 and the end of 2008, with the exception of the Company’s long-term debt. At September 30, 2009, the fair valu
e of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, was approximately $609.7. The fair value estimate was based on financial market information available to management as of September 30, 2009. Management is not aware of any significant factors that would materially alter this estimate since that date. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, at December 31, 2008 was approximately $515.8. The senior note indenture includes restrictive covenants regarding (a) the use of proceeds from asset sales, (b) some investments, (c) the amount of sale/leaseback transactions, and (d) transactions by subsidiaries and with affiliates. Furthermore, the senior note indenture imposes the following additional financial covenants: ● A minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 2.5 to 1 for the incurrence of debt. Failure to meet this covenant would not constitute an event of default. Rather it would limit the amount of additional debt the Company could incur to $100.0 beyond the borrowing available under our existing revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2009, the ratio fell below the 2.5 to 1 incurrence test. Other than the impact on borrowing noted above, noncompliance with this covenant does not materially impact the Company’s cash or liquidity position. The ratio is calculated by dividing the interest expense, including capitalized interest and fees on letters of credit, into EBITDA (defined, essentially, as operating income (i) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and restricted stock, extraordina
ry items and purchase accounting and asset distributions, (ii) adjusted for income before income taxes for discontinued operations, and (iii) reduced for the charges related to impairment of goodwill special charges, and pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligation corridor charges). The corridor charges are amortized over a 10-year period for this calculation. ● A limitation on “restricted payments,” which consist primarily of dividends and share repurchases, of $25.0 plus 50% of cumulative net income (or minus 100% of cumulative net loss) from April 1, 2002. As of September 30, 2009, the limitation on restricted payments is $58.6. The Company’s $850.0 five-year revolving credit facility secured by the Company’s inventory and accounts receivable contains restrictions on, among other things, distributions and dividends, acquisitions and investments, indebtedness, liens and affiliate transactions. In addition, the facility requires maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1 to 1 if availability under the facility is less than $125.0. "

term debt $ 1,169.4 $ 692.9 In July 2009, borrowing availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased from $300.0 million to $320.0 million. Amounts drawn under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin or the alternative base rate defined in the agreement. The interest rate margin applicable to LIBOR advances varies based on our credit rating. As of September 30, 2009, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and availability was $320.0 million. On June 2, 2009, we completed an offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 1/2% Senior Notes due 2019. The 2019 notes bear interest at 8.5% per annum, payable semiannually. We expect to use the proceeds from this offering, net of discount and issuance costs, of $492.4 million for general corporate purposes. The 2019 notes contain provisions that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, with certain exceptions, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, create liens and conso
lidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. If we are required to make an offer to repurchase our 7 3/8% Senior Notes due 2014 as a result of specified change in control events that result in a ratings decline, we will be required to make a concurrent offer to purchase the 2019 notes. The 2019 notes are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at our option at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. We will also pay accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. ASC Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (formerly FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)), applies to any convertible debt instrument that may be wholly or partially settled in cash and requires the separation of the debt and equity components of cash-settleable convertibles at the date of issuance. The accounting under ASC Subtopic 470-20, which we adopted January 1, 2009, required retrospective application for all periods presented and therefore must be applied to our $300 million 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2033, which were issued in May 2003 and retired in May 2008. We have calculated a theoretical non-cash interest expense based on a similar debt instrument carrying a fixed interest rate but excluding the equity conversion feature and measured at fair value at the time the notes were issued. As a result, under ASC Subtopic 470-20, the debt component determined for these notes was $251.8 million and the debt discount was $48.2 million. The equity component, recorded as additional paid-in capital, was $31.3 million, which represents the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the notes and the fair value of the liability, net of a deferred tax benefit of $16.9 million. The fixed interest rate was then applied to the debt component of the notes in the form of an original issuance discount and amortized over the life of the notes as a non-cash interest charge. This resulted in a non-cash increase of our historical interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, of $1.5 million, $9.2 million and $9.9 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 835-20, Capitalization of Interest Cost, we capitalized approximately $4.0 million of the incremental interest expense associated with the amortization of the debt discount. Application of these changes to our consolidated income statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 resulted in the following differences when compared to amounts previously reported: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 Additional pre-tax non-cash interest expense $ 1.5 Additional deferred tax benefit (0.5 ) &lt
;/tr> Retroactive change in net income and retained earnings $ 1.0 Change to basic earnings per share $ - Change to diluted earnings per share $ - An adjustment to reduce the prior period’s retained earnings in the amount of $28.8 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008, reflecting the cumulative impact of the adoption of ASC Subtopic 470-20 on our financial statements. The amortization of the debt discount required under ASC Subtopic 470-20 is a non-cash expense and has no impact on total operating, investing and financing cash flows in the prior period or future consolidated statements of cash flows. <

GENERAL Nature of Operations Pride In
ternational, Inc. (“Pride,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services. We provide these services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies through the operation and management of 23 offshore rigs. We also have four ultra-deepwater drillships under construction. Basis of Presentation On August 24, 2009, we completed the spin-off of our 20-rig mat-supported jackup business. In the third quarter of 2008, we entered into agreements to sell our Eastern Hemisphere land rig operations and completed the sale of all but one land rig used in those operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. The sale of the remaining land rig closed in the second quarter of 2009. The results of operations, for all periods presented, of the assets disposed of in these transactions have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. Except where noted, the discussions in the following notes relate to our continuing operations only (see Note 2). Our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. We believe that the presentation and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not misleading. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial information included herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statemen
ts and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. The results of operations for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year or any other interim period. In the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, all dollar and share amounts, other than per share amounts, in tabulations are in millions of dollars and shares, respectively, unless otherwise noted. Subsequent Events In preparing these financial statements, we have evaluated subsequent events through November 2, 2009, which is the date the financial statements are being issued. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Property and Equipment Property and equipment comprise a significant amount of our total assets. We determine the carrying value of these assets based on property and equipment policies that incorporate our estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to the carrying value, remaining useful lives and salvage value of our rigs and other assets. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. They involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets, and reflect management’s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels, dayrates and costs. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets and could materially affect our results of operations. Fair Value Accounting We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Our foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. See Note 5 – Derivatives and Financial Instruments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value. For accounting disclosure purposes, a three-level valuation hierarchy of fair value measurements has been established. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, we look to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets, and we are required to use alternative valuation techniques to derive an estimated fair value measurement. We adopted new guidance on January 1 and April 1, 2009 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. &l
t;/div> Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 810-10-65, Transition Related to FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests inConsolidated Financial Statements) establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, ASC Subtopic 810-10-65 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent’s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary. This subtopic is effective for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted the provisions of ASC Subtopic 810
- -10-65 on January 1, 2009, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (formerly SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations, and FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) SFAS 141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies), provides that all business combinations are required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting, but changes the method of applying the acquisition method from previous principles in a number of ways. Acquisition costs are no longer considered part of the fair value of an acquisition and will generally be expensed as incurred, noncontrolling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date, in-process research and development is recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. Contingent assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period. We adopted the changes to the provisions of ASC Topic 805 on January 1, 2009, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASC Subtopic 820-10-65, Transition Related to FSP FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly, provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. 0;This subtopic re-emphasizes that regardless of market conditions the fair value measurement is an exit price concept as defined in ASC 820. This subtopic clarifies and includes additional factors to consider in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset or liability and provides additional clarification on estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset or liability has declined significantly. The scope of this subtopic does not include assets and liabilities measured under quoted prices in active markets. ASC Subtopic 820-10-65 is applied prospectively to all fair value measurements where appropriate and will be effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10-65 effective April 1, 2009, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 825-10-65, Transition Related to FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments amends ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, to require publicly-traded companies, as defined in ASC Topic 270, Interim Reporting, to provide disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements. ASC Topic 825-10-65 is effective for interim periods en
ding after June 15, 2009. We adopted the new disclosure requirements in our second quarter 2009 financial statements with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASC Subtopic 320-10-65, Transition Related to FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (formerly FSP SFAS 115-2 and SFAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments issued in April 2009), provides transitional guidance for debt securities to make previous guidance more operational an
d to improve the presentation and disclosure of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. Existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities was not amended by this subtopic. This subtopic is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of this subtopic effective April 1, 2009, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events (formerly SFA
S No. 165, Subsequent Events issued May 2009) establishes (i) the period after the balance sheet date during which management shall evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements; (ii) the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements; and (iii) the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. This topic is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be applied prospectively. We adopted the provisions of this topic effective April 1, 2009, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing (formerly SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities-a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125, as amended by SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets – An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140, issued in June 2009) amends prior principles to require more disclosure about transfers of financial assets and the continuing exposure, retained by the transferor, to the risks related to transferred financial assets, including securitization transactions. It eliminates the concept of a “qualifying special-purpose entity,” changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosures. It also enhances information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and an entity’s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets. This topic will be effective at the start of a reporting entity’s first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009. Early application is not permitted. We will adopt the provisions of this topic effective January 1, 2010 and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASC Subtopic 810-10-05, Consolidation – Variable Interest Entities (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as amended by SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) in June 2009), defines how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. This topic requires a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. A reporting entity will be required to disc
lose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entity’s financial statements. This statement will be effective at the start of a reporting entity’s first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009. Early application is not permitted. We will adopt the provisions of this subtopic prospectively effective January 1, 2010 and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (formerly SFAS No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162), issued in June 2009, became the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date of this statement, the codification superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other nongrandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the codification became nonauthoritative. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of this topic in the third quarter of 2009, with no change to our consolidated financial statements other than changes in reference to various authoritative accounting pronouncements in our consolidated financial statements. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-05, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures – Measuring Liabilities and Fair Value, amending Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurement, to provide guidance on the manner in which the fair value of liabilities should be determined. This update provides clarification that, in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of defined valuation techniques. The amendments in this update also clarify that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. We will adopt ASU No. 2009-05 in the fourth quarter of 2009, and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform with the current year presentation. 82400000 0 698600000 752800000 0 -33600000 79900000 144200000 363500000 336300000 8100000000 10-Q 712500000 890400000 957500000 427900000 173500000 172700000 173400000 169900000 174900000 173800000 0.01 0.01 0000833081 Yes 477000000 -433300000 1000000 6600000 0 210800000 50000000 50000000 353800000 403400000 14900000 90500000 4200000 4200000 --12-31 PRIDE INTERNATIONAL INC 1600000 3500000 -5400000 0 -2700000 6100000 -3300000 15700000 100100000 185000000 436800000 411200000 100000 0 500000 -500000 30200000 26500000 85300000 95500000 4270300000 4400000000 125500000 137300000 1700000 1700000 2002600000 2038200000 -13300000 -16300000 2408200000 2243600000 800000 3100000 4400000000 4270300000 NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES FCPA Investigation During the cours
e of an internal audit and investigation relating to certain of our Latin American operations, our management and internal audit department received allegations of improper payments to foreign government officials. In February 2006, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors assumed direct responsibility over the investigation and retained independent outside counsel to investigate the allegations, as well as corresponding accounting entries and internal control issues, and to advise the Audit Committee. The investigation, which is continuing, has found evidence suggesting that payments, which may violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, were made to government officials in Venezuela and Mexi
co aggregating less than $1 million. The evidence to date regarding these payments suggests that payments were made beginning in early 2003 through 2005 (a) to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials for the purpose of extending drilling contracts for two jackup rigs and one semisubmersible rig operating offshore Venezuela; and (b) to one or more government officials, or to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials, for the purpose of collecting payment for work completed in connection with offshore drilling contracts in Venezuela. In addition, the evidence suggests that other payments were made beginning in 2002 through early 2006 (a) to one or more government officials in Mexico in connection with the clearing of a jackup rig and equipment through customs, the movement of personnel through immigration or the acceptance of a jackup rig under a drilling contract; and (b) with respect to the potentially improper entertain
ment of government officials in Mexico. The Audit Committee, through independent outside counsel, has undertaken a review of our compliance with the FCPA in certain of our other international operations. This review has found evidence suggesting that during the period from 2001 through 2006 payments were made directly or indirectly to government officials in Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Nigeria, Libya, Angola and the Republic of the Congo in connection with clearing rigs or equipment through customs or resolving outstanding issues with customs, immigration, tax, licensing or merchant marine authorities in those countries. In addition, this review has found evidence suggesting t
hat in 2003 payments were made to one or more third parties with the intent that they would be transferred to a government official in India for the purpose of resolving a customs dispute related to the importation of one of our jackup rigs. The evidence suggests that the aggregate amount of payments referred to in this paragraph is less than $2.5 million. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") has asked us to provide information with respect to (a) our relationships with a freight and customs agent and (b) our importation of rigs into Nigeria. The investigation of the matters described above and the Audit Committee's compliance review are ongoing. Accordingly, there can be no assurances t
hat evidence of additional potential FCPA violations may not be uncovered in those or other countries. Our management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors believe it likely that then members of our senior operations management either were aware, or should have been aware, that improper payments to foreign government officials were made or proposed to be made. Our former Chief Operating Officer resigned as Chief Operating Officer effective on May 31, 2006 and has elected to retire from the company, although he will remain an employee, but not an officer, during the pendency of the investigation to assist us with the investigation and to be available for consultation and to answer questions relating to our business. His retirement benefits will be subject to the determination by our Audit Committee or our Board of Directors that it does not have cause (as defined in his retirement agreement with us) to terminate his employment. Other personnel, including officers, have been terminated or placed on administrative leave or have resigned in connection with the investigation. We have taken and will continue to take disciplinary actions where appropriate and various other corrective action to reinforce our commitment to conducting our business ethically and legally and to instill in our employees our expectation that they uphold the highest levels of honesty, integrity, ethical standards and compliance with the law. We voluntarily disclosed information relating to the initial allegations and other information found in the investigation and compliance review to the DOJ and the SEC, and we have cooperated and continue to cooperate with these authorities. For any violations of the FCPA, we may be subject to fines, civil and criminal penalties, equitable remedies, including profit disgorgement, and injunctive relief. Civil penalties under the antibribery provisions of the FCPA could range up to $10,000 per violation, with a criminal fine up to the greater of $2 million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others, if larger. Civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the FCPA can range up to $500,000 per violation and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to $25 million per violation. In addition, both the SEC and t
he DOJ could assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts. Often, dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly a monitor being appointed to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the FCPA. We are engaged in discussions with the DOJ and the SEC regarding a potential negotiated resolution of these matters, which could be settled during 2009 and which, as described above, could involve a significant payment by us. We believe that it is likely that any settlement will include both crim
inal and civil sanctions. No amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines, sanctions, claims or other penalties, which could be material individually or in the aggregate, but an accrual could be made as early as the fourth quarter of 2009. There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in a final settlement of any or all of these issues or, if a settlement is reached, the timing of any such settlement or that the terms of any such settlement would not have a material adverse effect on us. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailmen
t of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets. Our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests. We could also face other third-party claims by directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, attorneys, agents, stockholders, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of our company. For additional information regarding a stockholder demand letter and related lawsuit with respect to these matters, please see the discussion below under ""- Demand Letter"". In addition, disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets. No amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines, sa
nctions, claims or other penalties referenced in this paragraph, which could be material individually or in the aggregate. We cannot currently predict what, if any, actions may be taken by the DOJ, the SEC, any other applicable government or other authorities or our customers or other third parties or the effect the actions may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, on our consolidated financial statements or on our business in the countries at issue and other jurisdictions. Environmental Matters We are currently subject to pending notices of assessment issued from 2002 to 2009 pursuant to which governmental authorities in Brazil are seeking fines in an aggregate amount of less than $750,000 for releases of drilling fluids from rigs operating offshore Brazil. We are contesting these notices. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously and, based on the information available to us at this time, we do not expect the outcome of these assessments to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation
s or cash flows; however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these assessments. We are currently subject to a pending administrative proceeding initiated in July 2009 by a governmental authority of Spain pursuant to which such governmental authority is seeking payment in an aggregate amount of approximately $4 million for an alleged environmental spill originating from the Pride North America while it was operating offshore Spain. We expect to be indemnified for any payments resulting from this incident by our client under the terms of the drilling contract. The client has posted guarantees wit
h the Spanish government to cover potential penalties. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously and, based on the information available to us at this time, we do not expect the outcome of the proceeding to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of the proceeding. Demand Letter In June 2009, we received a demand letter from counsel representing Kyle Arnold. The letter states that Mr. Arnold is one of our stockholders and that he believes that certain of our current and former officers and directors violated their fiduciary duties related to the issues described above under “—FCPA Investigation.” The letter requests that our Board of Directors take appropriate action against the individuals in question. In response to this letter, the Board has formed a special committee to evaluate the issues raised by the letter and determine a course of action for the company. The committee has retained counsel to advise it. Subsequent to the receipt of that demand letter, on October 14, 2009, Mr. Arnold filed suit in the state court of Harris County, Texas against us and certain of our current and former officers and dire
ctors. The lawsuit, like the demand letter, alleged that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to us related to the issues described above under “—FCPA Investigation.” Among other remedies, the lawsuit sought damages and equitable relief against the individual defendants, along with an award of attorney fees and other costs and expenses to the plaintiff. On October 16, 2009, the plaintiff dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. The special committee continues to evaluate these issues. Loss of Pride Wyoming In September 2008, the Pride Wyoming, a 250-foot slot-type jackup rig owned by Seahawk and operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, was deemed a total loss for insurance purposes after it was severely damaged and sank as a result of Hurricane Ike. Costs for removal of the wreckage are expected to be covered by our insurance. Under the master separation agreement between us and Seahawk, at Seahawk's option, we will be required to finance, on a revolving basis, all of the costs for removal of the wreckage and salvage operations until receipt of insurance proceeds. As of September 30, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under this financing arrangement.&a
mp;#160; Seahawk will be responsible for any costs not covered by our insurance. Potential Seahawk Tax-Related Guarantees In 2006 and 2007, Seahawk received tax assessments from the Mexican government related to the operations of certain of its subsidiaries. Seahawk is responsible for these a
ssessments following the spin-off. Pursuant to local statutory requirements, Seahawk has provided and may provide additional surety bonds or other suitable collateral to contest these assessments. Pursuant to a tax support agreement between us and Seahawk, we have agreed to guarantee or indemnify the issuer of any such surety bonds or other collateral issued for Seahawk’s account in respect of such Mexican tax assessments made prior to the spin-off date. The amount of such bonds or other collateral could total up to approximately $137.0 million based on current exchange rates. Beginning on July 31, 2012, on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, and on August 24, 2015, Seahawk will be required to provide substitute credit support for a portion of the collateral guaranteed or indemnified by us, so that our obligations are terminated in their entirety by August 24, 2015. Pursuant to the tax sup
port agreement, Seahawk is required to pay us a fee based on the actual credit support provided. As of September 30, 2009, we had not provided any guarantee or indemnification for any surety bonds or other collateral under the tax support agreement. Other We are routinely involved in other litigation, c
laims and disputes incidental to our business, which at times involve claims for significant monetary amounts, some of which would not be covered by insurance. In the opinion of management, none of the existing litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, a substantial settlement payment or judgment in excess of our accruals could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 600000 2000000 -23900000 56200000 0.45 0.82 2.06 1.96 174000000 173100000 NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER DIVESTITURES Discontinued Operations We report discontinued operations in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 205, Presentation of Financial Statements, and Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. We reclassify, from continuing operations to discontinued operations, for all periods presented, the results of operations for any asset group either held for sale or disposed of. We define an asset group as an operating group. Such reclassifications had no effect on our net income or stockholders’ equity. Spin-off of Mat-Supported J
ackup Business On August 24, 2009, we completed the spin-off of Seahawk Drilling, Inc. (“Seahawk”), which holds the assets and liabilities that were associated with our mat-supported jackup rig business. In the spin-off, our stockholders received 100% (approximately 11.6 million shares) of the outstanding common stock of Seahawk by way of a pro rata stock dividend. Each of our stockholders of record at the close of business on August 14, 2009 received one share of Seahawk common stock for every 15 shares of our common stock held by such stockholder and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Seahawk common stock to which such stockholder otherw
ise would have been entitled. The following table presents selected information regarding the results of operations of our former mat-supported jackup business: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2009 2008 font> 2009 2008 Revenues $ 30.8 $ 143.9 $ 189.4 $ 476.4 Operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization 30.7 77.4 161.6 247.7 Depreciation and amortization 8.4 14.2

;/td> 18.0 (71.0 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ (42.0 ) $ 35.4 $ (47.3 ) $ 131.7 In connection with the spin-off, we made a cash contribution to Seahawk of approximately $47.3 million to achieve a targeted working capital for Seahawk as of May 31, 2009 of $85 million. We and Seahawk also agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities that may arise or be incurred in the future attributable to our respective businesses. As of the date of the spin-off, per ASC Topic 360, we conducted a fair value assessment of the long-lived assets of Seahawk to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. We used multiple valuation methods and weighted the results of those methods for the final fair value determination. For the first valuation technique, we applied the income approach using a discounte
d cash flows methodology. Our valuation was based upon unobservable inputs that required us to make assumptions about the future performance of the mat-supported jackup rigs for which there is little or no market data, including projected demand, dayrates and operating costs. We also used a recent third-party valuation and recent analyst research reports for our second and third valuation methods. As a result of our fair value assessment, we determined that the carrying value of the Seahawk long-lived assets exceeded their fair value, resulting in an impairment loss of $33.4 million. We recorded the loss in income from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009. Sale of Eastern Hemisphere Land Rigs In the third quarter of 2008, we entered into agreements to sell our remaining seven land rigs for $95 million in cash. The sale of all but one rig closed in the fourth quarter of 2008. We leased the remaining rig to the buyer until the sale of that rig closed, which occurred in the second quarter of 2009. We recognized an after-tax gain of $5.2 million upon closing the sale of the last rig. Accordingly, this gain, the recognition of which had been previously deferred, was reflected in our income from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. 160;The following table presents selected information regarding the results of operations of this operating group: &lt

(1.4 ) Other Divestitures In February 2008, we completed the sale of our fleet of three self-erecting, tender-assist rigs for $213 million in cash. We operated one of the rigs until mid-April 2009, when we transitioned the operations of that rig to the owner. During the third quarter of 2007, we completed the disposition of our Latin America Land and E&P Services segments for $1.0 billion in cash. The purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments for various indemnities. From the closing date of the sale through September 30, 2009, we recorded a total gain on disposal of $325.4 million, w
hich included certain estimates for the settlement of closing date working capital, valuation adjustments for tax and other indemnities provided to the buyer and selling costs incurred by us. We have indemnified the buyer for certain obligations that may arise or be incurred in the future by the buyer with respect to the business. We believe it is probable that some of these liabilities will be settled with the buyer in cash. Our total estimated gain on disposal of assets includes a $29.7 million liability based on our fair value estimates for the indemnities. In December 2008, the final amount of working capital payable by the buyer to us was determined in accordance with the purchase agreement to be approximately $44.5 million, plus approximately $5.8 million of accrued interest to September 30, 2009. To date, the buyer has not made the required payment, and we have received no assurance that payment will be made. The buyer has made various tax and other indemnification claims totaling approxi
mately $39.9 million, as compared to our recorded liabilities related to these claims of $30.5 million. We continue to pursue collection of the amounts due to us and resolution of the tax and indemnification claims with the buyer. The expected settlement dates for the remaining tax indemnities vary from within one year to several years. Our final gain may be materially affected by the final resolution of these matters.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, clarifies that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share under the “two class” method described in ASC Subtopic 260-10-45. The “two class” method allocates undistributed earnings between common shares and participating securities. We have determined that our grants of unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities. We have prepared our current period earnings per share calculations and retrospectively revised our prior period calculations to exclude net income allocated to these unvested restricted stock awards. As a result, basic and diluted income from continuing operations per share decreased by $0.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2008 and $0.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2008. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and the denominator of our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Income from continuing operations $ 79.9 $ 144.2 $ 363.5 &l

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, foreign currency forward contracts and debt. The estimated fair value of our debt at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $1,285.3 million and $702.5 million, respectively, which differs from the carrying amounts of $1,199.7 million and $723.2 million, respectively, included in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our debt has been estimated based on quarter- and year-end quoted market prices. The following table presents the carrying amount and estimated fair value of our financial instruments recognized at fair value on a recurring basis: September 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 Estimated Fair Value Measurements Carrying Amount Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) <

t;/td> $ 0.2 $ 0.2 The foreign currency forward contracts have been valued using a combined income and market-based valuation methodology based on forward exchange curves and credit. These curves are obt
ained from independent pricing services reflecting broker market quotes. Our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are by their nature short-term. As a result, the carrying value included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. Cash Flow Hedging We have a foreign currency hedging program to moderate the change in value of forecasted payroll transactions and related costs denominated in Euros. We are hedging a portion of these payroll and related costs using forward contracts. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro, the decline in the value of the forward contracts is offset by lower future payroll costs. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in value of forward contracts offsets higher future payroll costs. The maximum amount of time that we are hedging our exposure to Euro-denominated forecasted payroll costs is six months. The aggregate notional amount of these forward contracts, expressed in U.S. dollars, was $6.1 million at September 30, 2009. All of our foreign currency forward contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). The fair market value of these derivative instruments is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities, with the cumulative unrealized gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair market value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts resulted in an asset of approximately $0.2 million at September 30, 2009. Hedge effectiveness is measured quarterly based on the relative cumulative changes in fair value between derivative contracts and the hedged i
tem over time. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings and recorded to other income (expense). We did not recognize a gain or loss due to hedge ineffectiveness in our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 related to these derivative instruments. The balance of the net unrealized gain related to our foreign currency forward contracts in accumulated other comprehensive income is as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 2008 Net unrealized gain at beginning of period $ 0.2 $ - Activity during period: td> Settlement of forward contracts outstanding at beginning of period (0.2 ) - Net unrealized gain (loss) on outstanding foreign currency forward contracts 0.2 (0.2 ) Net unrealized gain (loss) at end of period $ 0.2 $ (0.2 ) 6300000 21200000 22300000 529100000 0.45 0.82 2.06 1.89 0.19 1.08 1.80 3.59 210600000 206400000 615900000 565700000 0 0 2009-09-30 NOTE 10.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS Our stock-based compensation plans provide for the granting or awarding of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards and cash awards to directors, officers and other key employees. Under the terms of our stock-based compensation plans, the number of shares available for awards under the plans was adjusted pursuant to the terms of the plans to prevent dilution as a result of the spin-off of Seahawk. This adjustment resulted in additional shares being made available for awards under the plans in the following amounts: 366,404 shares under our 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 5,991 shares under our 2004 Directors' Stock Incentive Plan. An adjustment was also made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to add an additional 8,798 shares available for issuance under the plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we granted approximately 1,189,000 stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $17.58. The weig
hted average fair value per share of these stock-based awards estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $10.38. The implied volatility used to calculate the Black-Scholes fair value of stock-based awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased to 68.7% from 35.1% in 2008, due to the significant changes in the market price of our common stock in 2008. With the exception of volatility, there were no other significant changes in the weighted average assumptions used to calculate the Black-Scholes fair value of stock-based awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 from those used in 2008 as reported in Note 11 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we also granted approximately 1,797,000 restricted stock unit awards with a weighted average grant-date fair value per share of $16.65. The restricted stock unit awards granted during 2009, but prior to the Seahawk spin-off, were modified at the time of the spin-off to increase the number of units to reflect the stock dividend associated with the underlying shares. We granted 107,847 additional units, with a weighted average grant-date fair value per share of $26.54 on the date of the spin-off. Restricted stock unit awards that were granted prior to 2009 and were unvested at the time of the spin-off were not modified, but the holders received a cash dividend in lieu of additional units. As a result of Pride employees transferring to Seahawk, 189,592 restricted stock unit awards were forfeited. Awards of restricted stock that were unvested at the time of the spin-off were not modified, bu
t the holders of those restricted stock awards participated in the spin-off on the same basis as the holders of our common stock and received one fully vested share of Seahawk common stock for every 15 shares of restricted stock held by the holder. In connection with the spin-off of Seahawk, we modified the outstanding stock options to preserve the intrinsic value of each option to the holder. The spin-off modifications resulted in an incremental increase in outstanding options of 270,912 and a corresponding incremental compensation expense of $1.1 million, of which $0.6 million is reflected in our income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009. The weighted average exercise price of the modified options was $22.39 and the weight
ed average fair value per share on the date of the spin-off was $9.55. The fair value per share was calculated using expected terms of 0.1 to 4.7 years, implied volatilities ranging from 41.51% to 45.67% and risk free interest rates ranging from 0.12% to 2.48%. 0 -11400000 83200000 55500000 NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we estimate the full-year tax rate from continuing operations and apply this rate to our year-to-date income from continuing operations. In addition, we separately calculate the tax impact of unusual items, if any. For the three months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008, our consolidated effective tax rate for continuing operations was 18.5% and 24.9%, respectively
. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 our consolidated effective tax rate for continuing operations was 16.6% and 20.1%, respectively. The lower tax rate for the 2009 period was principally the result of increased profitability in lower tax jurisdictions and tax benefits related to the finalization of certain tax returns. -40300000 -45600000 0 2100000 100000 19900000 400000000 400000000 0.01 0.01 2243600000 2408200000 16300000 13300000 5815500000 6067800000 100000 100000 7300000 900000 4900000 -12600000 -500000 -20800000 33400000 0 35600000 189100000 318600000 616400000 318600000 98000000 191900000 436000000 420900000 6600000 7800000 24400000 31000000 900000 700000 0 0 39500000 38000000 118300000 109700000 5800000 7400000 21600000 29800000 6154900000 6069000000 NOTE 3.

8,2009-11-02,1276520,XBRL," (8) Borrowings and Other
Financings Commercial
Paper Facility We have a $1.0
billion commercial paper program whereby notes are offered pursuant
to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933
and may have a maturity of up to 364 days from the date of issue.
However, during the second half of 2008, the unfavorable liquidity
environment impacted our ability to issue commercial paper and the
downgrade of our holding company resulted in us being ineligible to
participate in the Federal Reserve’s Commercial Paper Funding
Facility (“CPFF”) which went into effect in
October 2008. The $203 million of outstanding commercial paper
as of December 31, 2008 was held by CPFF until maturity and
was fully repaid in February 2009. In the current market
environment, we do not anticipate issuing commercial
paper. Revolving
Credit Facilities We have a $1.0
billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in May
2012 and a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that
matures in August 2012. These facilities bear variable interest
rates based on one-month London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus a margin. Lehman Commercial Paper Inc.
(“LCP”) had committed $70 million under the August 2012
credit facility and Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (“Lehman
FSB”) had committed $70 million under the May 2012 credit
facility. On October 5, 2008, LCP filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York. LCP was unable to
fulfill its commitments under the August 2012 credit facility and
Lehman FSB declined to fulfill its commitment under the May 2012
credit facility. Therefore, we only have access to $1.9 billion
under these facilities. As of
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had
borrowings of $930 million under these facilities. As of
September 30, 2009, we utilized $107 million under these
facilities primarily for the issuance of letters of credit for the
benefit of one of our life insurance subsidiaries. As of
December 31, 2008, we utilized $184 million under these
facilities primarily for the issuance of letters of credit for the
benefit of one of our U.S. mortgage insurance
subsidiaries. Long-Term
Senior Notes During the
third quarter of 2009, we repurchased principal of $73 million of
our 5.65% senior notes that mature in June 2012, plus accrued
interest. During the second quarter of 2009, we repaid principal of
$329 million of our 5.23% senior notes that matured in May 2009,
plus accrued interest. During the first quarter of 2009, we
repurchased principal of $79 million of our 4.75% senior notes,
plus accrued interest. During the second quarter of 2009, we repaid
the remaining principal of $331 million of our 4.75% senior notes
that matured in June 2009, plus accrued interest. We have no
additional long-term senior notes maturing until
mid-2011. Non-Recourse
Funding Obligations As of
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had $3.4
billion of fixed and floating rate non-recourse funding obligations
outstanding backing additional statutory reserves. Of these
obligations, $1.7 billion were guaranteed by third-party
financial guaranty insurance companies and the interest rates on
these obligations are subject to rate resets triggered by negative
rating agency actions on the third-party financial guaranty
insurance companies that guarantee these obligations. During 2008,
the rates on those $1.7 billion of non-recourse funding obligations
were contractually reset to the highest margin to the related
underlying index rates. On
March 25, 2009, River Lake Insurance Company IV Limited, our
wholly-owned subsidiary, repaid $12 million of its total
outstanding $40 million Class B Floating Rate Subordinated Notes
due May 25, 2028 following an early redemption event, in
accordance with the priority of payments. As of
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the
weighted-average interest rates on our non-recourse funding
obligations were 1.41% and 3.76%, respectively, reflecting the
decline in the underlying index rate.

pursuant to a cash tender offer. The tender offer consideration per
$1,000 principal amount of these notes accepted for purchase was
$1,000, with an early tender payment of $30. Payments for these

million of these notes in the second quarter of 2009 in open market
transactions. On June 8, 2009, the Company issued $300 million of
unsecured senior notes which mature June 28, 2019 and carry a fixed
interest rate of 7.30%. Interest payments are due semi-annually in
arrears on June 28 and December 28, commencing December 28,
2009. On June 3, 2009, the Company issued $200 million of
unsecured senior notes which mature June 15, 2039 and carry a fixed
interest rate of 7.75%. Interest payments are due quarterly in
arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15,

6,2009-11-03,315293,XBRL," 8. Debt On July 1, 2009, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Aon issued 500 million ($734 million at September 30, 2009
exchange rates) of 6.25% senior unsecured debentures due on July 1,
2014. The payment of the principal and interest on the
debentures is unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by
Aon. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay the
Companys $677 million outstanding indebtedness under its Euro
credit facility. In 1997, Aon created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned
statutory business trust (Trust), for the purpose of issuing
mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (Capital
Securities). Aon received cash and an investment in 100% of
the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing 8.205% Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the Debentures) to
Aon Capital A. These transactions were structured such that
the net cash flows from Aon to Aon Capital A matched the cash flows
from Aon Capital A to the third party investors. Aon
determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital
A, a VIE, and, thus reflected the Debentures as long-term debt.
During the first half of 2009, Aon repurchased $15 million face
value of the Capital Securities for approximately $10 million,
resulting in a $5 million gain reflected in other (income) expense
in the condensed consolidated statement of income. To
facilitate the legal release of the obligation created through the
Debentures associated with this repurchase and future repurchases,
Aon dissolved the Trust effective June 25, 2009. This
dissolution resulted in the exchange of the Capital Securities held
by third parties for the Debentures. Also in connection with
the dissolution of the Trust, the $24 million of common equity of
Aon Capital A held by Aon was exchanged for $24 million of
Debentures, which were then cancelled. Following these
actions, $687 million of Debentures remain outstanding. The
Debentures are subject to mandatory redemption on January 1, 2027
or are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the option of Aon
upon the occurrence of certain events. Also during the second quarter of 2009, $100 million of
short-term debt owned by a VIE where Aon is the primary
beneficiary, was repaid.

maturity in whole or in part at 100 percent of the principal plus
any accrued but unpaid interest and any applicable make-whole
amounts. See Note N for condensed consolidating financial
statements. Commercial
Paper On
October 4, 2009, we had no commercial paper outstanding but
maintain the ability to access the market. We have approximately
$1.8 billion in bank credit facilities that provide backup
liquidity to our commercial paper program. These credit facilities
consist of an $815 364-day facility expiring in July 2010 and a
$975 multi-year facility expiring in December 2011. These
facilities are required by rating agencies to support the A1/P1
rating of our commercial paper issuances. Our commercial paper
issuances and the bank credit facilities are guaranteed by several
of our 100-percent-owned subsidiaries. Additionally, a number of
our international subsidiaries have available local bank credit
facilities aggregating approximately $970.

$19,450) 17,753 17,630 Total long-term debt $ 523,753 $ 587,630 Bank Debt In April 2009, we entered into a new three-year senior
secured revolving credit facility (credit facility). The
new credit facility increases bank commitments from $500 million to
$800 million, with a borrowing base of $1 billion. The credit
facility is provided by a syndicate of banks led by JP Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A., matures on April 14, 2012 and is secured by mortgages
on certain of our oil and gas properties and the stock of certain
wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. The borrowing base under the credit agreement is
determined at the discretion of the lenders, based on the
collateral value of our proved reserves, and is subject to
potential special and regular semi-annual
redeterminations. The credit facility contains covenants and restrictive
provisions which may limit our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The
credit facility requires us to maintain a current ratio greater
than 1 to 1 and a leverage ratio not to exceed 3.5 to 1. As
of September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all of the
financial and non-financial covenants. At Cimarexs option, borrowings under the credit facility
may bear interest at either (a) a London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) plus 2 to 3 percent, based on borrowing base usage,
or (b) the higher of (i) a prime rate, (ii) the federal funds
effective rate plus 0.50 percent, or (iii) adjusted LIBOR, in each
case, plus an additional 1.125 to 2.125 percent, based on borrowing
base usage. At September 30, 2009, there was $156 million of
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at a weighted
average interest rate of approximately 3.1%. We also had letters of
credit outstanding of $17.7 million leaving an unused
borrowing availability of $626.3 million. 7.125% Notes due
2017 In May, 2007, we issued $350 million of 7.125% senior
unsecured notes that mature May 1, 2017 at par. Interest on the
notes is payable May 1 and November 1 of each year. The notes are
governed by an indenture containing covenants that could limit our
ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or
repurchase our common stock; make investments and other restricted
payments; incur liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions;
engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and
consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in
part, at any time on and after May 1, 2012 at the following
redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal
amount) plus accrued interest, if any, thereon to the date of
redemption. Year Percentage 2012 103.6 % 2013 102.4 % 2014 101.2 % 2015 and thereafter 100.0 % At any time prior to May 1, 2010, we may redeem up to 35%
of the original principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of
certain equity offerings of our shares of common stock at a
redemption price of 107.125% of the principal amount of the notes,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
redemption. At any time prior to May 1, 2012, we may also
redeem all, but not part, of the notes at a price of 100% of the
principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest plus
a make-whole premium. If a specified change of control occurs, subject to
certain conditions, we must make an offer to purchase the notes at
a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase. Floating rate
convertible notes due 2023 The floating rate convertible senior notes mature on
December 15, 2023. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and
bear interest at the three month LIBOR, reset quarterly. On
September 30, 2009, the interest rate approximated 0.3%. In December 2008, holders of $105.5 million of the
original $125 million issuance amount elected to submit their notes
for repurchase. We repurchased the $105.5 million in notes with
borrowings under our credit facility. Holders of the remaining
$19.5 million of notes have optional repurchase dates of December
15, 2013, and 2018. In addition to the repurchase rights, holders of the
convertible notes may surrender their notes for conversion into a
combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon the
occurrence of certain circumstances, including if the price of our
common stock has been trading above 110% of the conversion price of
$28.59 per share for a defined period of time. As of September 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, the notes were not convertible. However, based on the price of our common stock during September
2009, the notes became convertible effective October 1,
2009. At our option, we may offer to redeem the notes at any
time at par. In addition, if a change of control occurs,
subject to certain conditions, we must make an offer to purchase
the notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal
amount. In May 2008, the FASB issued new guidance that changed the
accounting for the components of convertible debt that can be
settled wholly or partly in cash upon conversion. The new
requirements are required to be applied to both new instruments and
retrospectively to previously issued convertible instruments. The
debt and equity components of the instruments are accounted for
separately. The value assigned to the debt component is the
estimated value of similar debt without a conversion feature as of
the issuance date, with the remaining proceeds allocated to the
equity component and recorded as additional paid-in capital. The
debt component is recorded at a discount and is subsequently
accreted to its par value, thereby reflecting an overall market
rate of interest in the income statement. The effective
interest rate for the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and 2008
was 1.5% and 4%, respectively. The effective interest rate
for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 was 2.3% and
4.7%, respectively. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The
following table reflects a comparison of certain financial
statement line items affected by the retrospective application of

7,2009-11-03,1163165,XBRL,"Note 9—Debt In February 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014, $2.25 billion of 5.75% Notes due 2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039. In addition, in May 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.60% Notes due 2015, $1.0 billion of 6.00% Notes due 2020 and an additional $500 million of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances and for general corporate purposes. During the first nine months of 2009, we used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to redeem $284 million of 6.375% Notes and $950 million of Floating Rate Notes upon their maturity. At September 30, 2009, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $7.85 billion, consisting of a $7.35 billion facility, expiring in September 2012, and a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. The facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program, as support for the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, or as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. At both September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued. Under both ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $2,342 million of commercial paper was outstanding at September 30, 2009, compared with $6,933 million at December 31, 2008. Since we had $2,342 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $5.5 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009, we classified $1,037 million of short-term debt as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facility."

2,733,543 As of October 2, 2009 and March 31, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Company’s $2.0 billion credit facility, and the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under this credit facility. On July 31, 2009, the Company paid $195.0 million to redeem the Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes upon their maturity. These notes carried conversion provisions to issue shares to settle any conversion spread (excess of the conversion value over the face value) in stock. The face value was $10.50 per share. On the maturity date, the Company’s stock price was less than the face value, and therefore no shares were issued. During June 2009, the Company paid approximately $203.2 million to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $99.8 million of its outstanding 6 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the “6 1/2% Notes”) and an aggregate principal amount of $99.9 million of its outstanding 6 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the “6 1/4% Notes” and collectively referred to as the “Notes”) in a cash tender offer (the “Offer”). The cash paid included $8.8 million in consent fees (as discussed further below) paid to holders of the Notes that were tendered but not purchased as well as to holders that consented but did not tender, which were capitalized and will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes. The Company recognized an immaterial gain during the six-month period ended October 2, 2009 associated with the partial extinguishment of the Notes, net of approximately $5.3 million for transaction costs and the write-down of related debt issuance costs, which is included in Other charges, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. In conjunction with the Offer, the Company obtained consents from the holders of Notes tendered but not purchased, as well as from holders that consented but did not tender, to certain amendments to the restricted payments covenants and certain related definitions in each of the indentures (the “Indentures”) under which the Notes were issued. The amendments permit the Company greater flexibility to purchase or make other payments in respect of its equity securities and debt that is subordinated to the Notes and to make certain other restricted payments under each Indenture. Adjustments to Beginning Accumulated Deficit and Interest Expense On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted a new accounting standard related to accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion. The adoption of the new standard affected the accounting for the Company’s 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes and Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes (collectively referred to as the “Convertible Notes”) by requiring the initial proceeds from their sale to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that results in interest expense on the debt component at the Company’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the date of issuance. The standard required the Company to record the change in accounting principle retrospectively to all periods presented, which included cumulative effect adjustments as of March 31, 2009 to the opening balance of Accumulated deficit of approximately $225.0 million, an approximate $27.6 million reduction in the carrying value of the Convertible Notes, an increase in the recorded value of Ordinary shares of approximately $252.0 million, which represents the carrying amount of the equity component, and a reduction to deferred financing costs of approximately $525,000, which is included in Other assets. The adjustment to Accumulated deficit represented imputed interest for the period from issuance of each convertible note to March 31, 2009, and a $5.8 million reduction in the gain recognized during the three-month period ended December 31, 2008 for the partial extinguishment of the 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Coupon interest expense and discount amortization related to the original issuance costs was immaterial for all periods presented. The estimated fair value of the initial debt components of the Company’s 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes and Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes were $310.9 million and $111.3 million, respectively, based on the present value of the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate comparable market nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance. The Company is amortizing the discounts using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense. The amortization of the discount resulted in effective interest rates of 8.21% for the 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 9.23% for the Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes. The adoption of the new standard had no impact on the Company’s consolidated cash flows. Below is a summary of the financial statement effects of implementing the new standard on the affected notes and interest expense.

Basic and diluted net income per share decreased by $0.01 and $0.03 for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 26, 2008, respectively. Fair Values As of October 2, 2009, the approximate fair values of the Company’s 6.5% Senior Subordinated Notes, 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes, 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes and debt outstanding under its Term Loan Agreement were 97.0%, 96.0%, 97.1% and 91.3% of the face values of the debt obligations, respectively, based on broker trading prices. Interest Expense During the three-month and six-month periods ended October 2, 2009, the Company recognized interest expense of $39.3 million and $85.5 million (including $5.5 million and $13.5 million for the application of the new accounting standard discussed above, respectively, on its debt obligations outstanding during the period. During the three-month and six-month periods ended September 26, 2008, the Company recognized interest expense of $64.8 million and $134.1 million (including $11.4 million and $22.5 million for the retrospective application of the new accounting standard), respectively, on its debt obligations.

Committed credit available
under our five-year revolving credit facility maturing in December
2012 provides the ability to issue our commercial paper obligations
on a long-term basis. Therefore, at September 30, 2009, as we
had both the ability and intent to refinance these obligations on a
long-term basis, our commercial paper borrowings were classified as
long-term on the consolidated balance sheets. Commercial paper
borrowings as of September 30, 2009, had an average interest
rate of 0.46%. On
January 13, 2009, we entered into a $350 million 364-day
revolving committed credit agreement maturing in January 2010.
Borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at a rate
equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by
reference to the higher of (1) the agent’s prime rate,
(2) the federal funds rate plus 1/2
of 1% or
(3) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
plus 1.00%; or (b) LIBOR plus 2.25%. The margin over LIBOR is
variable and is determined based on our credit rating. Among other
restrictions, the terms of the credit agreement include negative
covenants related to liens and a financial covenant related to the
debt-to-earnings ratio. We now have combined committed bank lines
of $950 million, including a $600 million, five-year revolving
credit facility that matures in December 2012.

3,331 Term Loans On May 14, 2009, Discovery Communications Holding, LLC (“DCH”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”) to its Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of May 14, 2007 with Bank of America, N.A. (as administrative agent and a lender) and the other lenders named therein (“Term Loan B”). The Amendment revises Term Loan B to permit any indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred by any restricted subsidiary, as defined in Term Loan B, or DCH to contain restrictions similar to provisions in DCH’s and its subsidiaries’ existing credit facility and privately placed notes, subject to certain conditions. These provisions include restrictions on limitations on guarantees, liens and restricted payments. Term Loan B was further amended in order to eliminate DCH’s obligation to give existing lenders ten business days to commit to any additional term facility. On May 14, 2009, DCH entered into Credit Agreement Supplement No. 1 (“Term Loan C”) to its Term Loan B with Bank of America N.A. (as administrative agent and lender). Pursuant to Term Loan C, DCH incurred $500 million of indebtedness, which matures on May 14, 2014. DCH received net proceeds of $478 million from the borrowing after deducting issuance expenses of $12 million recorded as a discount and $10 million of expenses recorded as deferred financing costs. DCH used the net proceeds of the borrowing to repay $163 million and $315 million of indebtedness outstanding under DCL’s Term Loan A and the revolving credit facility, respectively. The Term Loan C indebtedness is repayable in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million beginning June 30, 2009 through March 31, 2014, with the balance due on the maturity date. Term Loan C bears interest at an initial rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 2.00%, which was 5.25% at September 30, 2009. From May 14, 2009 through September 30, 2009, the weighted average effective interest rate for Term Loan C was 6.03%. Term Loan C contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants (which impose restrictions and limitations on, among other things, dividends, investments, additional indebtedness, asset sales and capital expenditures) and a total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant, each of which are identical to Term Loan B. DCH is permitted to prepay Term Loan C in whole or in part at any time at its option with prior notice with no prepayment penalty. The events of default under Term Loan C are identical to those under Term Loan B. Discovery’s $1.5 billion Term Loan B and $500 million Term Loan C are each secured by the assets of DCH, excluding assets held by DCH’s subsidiaries. Senior Notes On August 19, 2009, Discovery Communications, LLC (“DCL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes maturing on August 15, 2019 (the “August 2019 Notes”). The August 2019 Notes were issued in an underwritten public offering at a price of 99.428% of the principal amount. DCL received net proceeds of $492 million from the offering after deducting the issuance discount of $3 million and issuance expenses of $5 million recorded as deferred financing costs. DCL used the net proceeds of the offering to repay $428 million of indebtedness outstanding under its Term Loan A, prior to final maturity on October 31, 2010. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. DCL may, at its option, redeem some or all of the August 2019 Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. Interest on the August 2019 Notes is payable on August 15 and February 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2010. The August 2019 Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of DCL’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The August 2019 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Discovery. The August 2019 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture and a supplemental indenture, dated as of August 19, 2009, among DCL, Discovery and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The indenture and supplemental indenture contain certain covenants and events of default and other customary provisions. Debt Payments The following table presents a summary of scheduled and estimated debt payments, excluding capital lease obligations and other notes payable, for the remainder of 2009 and each of the succeeding four years based on the amount of debt outstanding as of September 30, 2009 (in millions).

2,769 Covenants The term loans, revolving loan, and senior notes contain covenants that require the Company to meet certain financial ratios and place restrictions on the payment of dividends, sale of assets, borrowing level, mergers, and purchases of capital stock, assets, and investments. The Company was compliant with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Fair Value of Debt The fair value of the Company’s borrowings was $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, which was estimated based on current market rates and credit pricing for similar debt types and maturities.

debt. In January 2006, we executed a five-year, unsecured
revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) totaling $175.0
million. Under the Credit Facility, outstanding balances accrue
interest at 50.0 to 100.0 basis points over the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other bank-developed rates, at our
option. The commitment fee on the unused balance ranges from
12.5 to 20.0 basis points. The increment over LIBOR and the
commitment fee are determined quarterly based upon the ratio of
total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization (EBITDA), as defined. The remaining availability
under our line of credit, reduced for certain outstanding letters
of credit, approximated $58.0 million and $31.1 million as of
September 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008, respectively.
The fair value of our outstanding debt approximates the carrying
value since our debt agreements are variable-rate
instruments. The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and
negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring the
maintenance of specified fixed charges and leverage ratios. At
September 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008, we were in
compliance with these covenants. We presently have two interest rate swap agreements
(swaps) that provide fixed interest rates, as compared to LIBOR,
as follows: Floating
Rate Debt Fixed
Rates The first interest rate swap agreement: January 16, 2007 to January 15,
2009 $ 60 million 4.98 % January 15, 2009 to January 15,
2011 $ 50 million 4.98 % The second interest rate swap agreement: January 31, 2009 to January 31,
2011 $ 50 million 3.74 % Our swaps are derivative instruments that are designated
as cash flow hedges because the swaps provide a hedge against the
effects of rising interest rates on present and/or forecasted
future borrowings. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the
swaps is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during
which the swaps affect earnings. Gains or losses on the swaps
representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in
current earnings. Amounts payable or receivable under the swaps are
accounted for as adjustments to interest expense. The following tables provide information on the location
and amounts of our swaps in the accompanying consolidated financial

over-hedged during the third quarter of 2009 since the outstanding
debt balance associated with this swap was $49 million (floating
rate debt of the swap is $50 million). The weighted average interest rates for our Credit
Facility, including the impact of the previously mentioned swap
agreements, were 4.98% and 4.74% for the three months ended
September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively,
and 4.75% and 5.04% for the nine months ended September 27,
2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. Interest paid,
including payments made or received under the swaps, was $1.3
million and $4.1 million for the three and nine months ended
September 27, 2009, respectively, compared to $1.9 million and
$5.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 28,
2008, respectively. As of September 27, 2009, the portion of
the $4.8 million interest rate swap liability that would be
reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as interest
expense approximates $3.6 million.

As a result of ratings downgrades in the first quarter of 2009, the Company was required to pay the commercial paper issued under the CPFF program from existing sources of liquidity. As of April 30, 2009, the Company has repaid commercial paper of $375, representing the full amount issued under the CPFF, at their maturity dates.

2,2009-11-03,765880,XBRL," (10) Debt Bank Line of Credit and Bridge and Term Loans The Companys revolving line of credit facility with a
syndicate of banks provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of
$1.5 billion and matures on August 1, 2011. This revolving line of
credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR
plus a margin ranging from 0.325% to 1.00%, depending upon the
Companys debt ratings. The Company pays a facility fee on the
entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, depending
upon its debt ratings. Based on the Companys debt ratings
at September 30,
2009, the margin on
the revolving line of credit facility was 0.55% and the facility
fee was 0.15%. At September 30, 2009, the Company had
no
outstanding amounts under
this revolving line of credit facility. At September 30, 2009, the outstanding balance of the
Companys term loan was $200 million and matures on August 1, 2011.
The term loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR
plus a margin ranging from 1.825% to 2.375%, depending upon the
Companys debt ratings (weighted-average effective interest rate of 2.73% at
September 30, 2009).
Based on the Companys debt ratings at
September 30,
2009, the margin on
the term loan was 2.00%. The Companys revolving line of credit facility and term
loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary
requirements, including cross-default provisions to other
indebtedness. Among other things, these covenants, using terms
defined in the agreement (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total
Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit
the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset
Value to 65%, (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75
times, and (iv) require a formula-determined Minimum Consolidated
Tangible Net Worth of $4.9 billion
at September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009, the Company was in
compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the
revolving line of credit facility and term loan. On May 8, 2009, the Company repaid the remaining $320
million outstanding balance under its bridge loan credit facility
with proceeds received from the issuance of shares of its common
stock. Senior Unsecured Notes At September 30, 2009, the Company had $3.5 billion
in aggregate principal
amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates on the
notes ranged from 1.20% to 7.07%. The weighted-average effective
interest rate on the senior unsecured notes at
September 30, 2009 was
6.13%. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense
over the term of the related notes. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants
including limitations on debt, cross-acceleration provisions and
other customary terms. At September 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance
with these covenants. Mortgage and Other Secured Debt At September 30, 2009, the Company had $1.9 billion in
mortgage debt secured by 168 healthcare facilities with a carrying
value of $2.4 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged
from 0.33% to 8.63% with a weighted average effective rate of 5.10%
at September 30, 2009. On August 3, 2009, in connection with the Companys
purchase of a $720 million (face value) participation in first
mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare, the Company incurred $425 million
in secured debt financing. This debt matures in January 2013,
subject to certain conditions, and is secured by the first mortgage
debt participation. See Note 6 for additional disclosures regarding
this participating interest pledged as collateral for this
debt. On August 27, 2009, the Company repaid early $100 million
of variable-rate mortgage debt. The mortgage debt, with an original
maturity of January 2010, was repaid with proceeds from the
Companys August 2009 public equity offering and third quarter
asset sales. Mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and
interest payments, is collateralized by certain properties and is
generally non-recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts transfer
of the encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts
prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires
maintenance of the properties in good condition, requires
maintenance of insurance on the properties and includes
requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate
material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also
cross-collateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants
or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or
operating agreements of such properties. Other Debt At September 30, 2009, the Company had
$99
million of non-interest
bearing life care bonds at two of its CCRCs and non-interest
bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of its senior housing
facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the
facilities (collectively, Life Care
Bonds). At September
30, 2009, $44 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the
residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon
death, and $55 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable after
the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident. Debt Maturities The following table summarizes our stated debt maturities

expense. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had no
outstanding interest rate swap contracts. As of December 31,
2008, the fair values of the interest rate swaps were $622 million

Debt The components of debt at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are as follows: September 30, December 31, 2009 2008 Convertible subordinated debentures $ 7,816 $ 7,464 Borrowings under revolving credit facility 25,000 79,500 Capital lease obligations 1,651 2,230 $ 34,467 $ 89,194 In March 2009, the Company amended its $150.0 million five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) and extended its maturity to May 31, 2011. The $150.0 million Facility was restructured as an asset-based loan consisting of a revolving credit facility of $123.0 million (the “Revolver”) and $27.0 million in Term Loans. As discussed in Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in October 2009 the Company amended and extended its Revolver through May 2013. The $123.0 million Revolver has an interest rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 4.00% in the case of Eurodollar loans or a base rate plus 3.00% in the case of Base Rate loans. The Revolver is secured by substantially all assets of the Company as well as by pledges of stock and guaranties of certain operating subsidiaries. The Revolver includes a $15.0 million sub-facility which is available to the Company’s Canadian subsidiary. The Revolver also includes a $25.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit and a $14.0 million sub-limit for swing line loans. The Company’s ability to borrow under the $123.0 million Revolver is subject to periodic borrowing base determinations. The borrowing base consists primarily of certain eligible accounts receivable and inventories. Borrowings under the Revolver are based on predetermined advance rates based on assets (generally up to 85% of billed receivables, 80% of eligible unbilled receivables and 50% of certain inventories including work-in-process). As of September 30, 2009, the Company had $25.0 million outstanding under the Revolver, which is classified as long-term debt since the Revolver expires in May 2013. The $27.0 million Term Loans were comprised of a $20.0 million Term Loan and a $7.0 million Term Loan. The Term Loans were repaid in their entirety in August 2009 using the net proceeds from the Company’s equity offering which is discussed in more detail in Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to repayment the Term Loans had an interest rate based on LIBOR plus 4.25% in the case of Eurodollar loans or a base rate plus 3.25% in the case of Base Rate loans. The Facility requires compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage covenant as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to pay cash dividends, incur debt and liens, and engage in mergers and acquisitions and sales of assets, among other things. The Company was in compliance with all loan covenants as of September 30, 2009. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, the average interest rate on the Company’s Facility approximated 4.61% and 3.98%, respectively. As of September 30, 2009, the Company paid approximately $5.5 million of costs related to the amendment and extension of the Facility. These costs primarily consisted of bank fees and fees paid to attorneys and other third-party professionals. Approximately $0.8 million of the unamortized fees were written off upon the repayment of the Term Loans in August 2009 and have been reported as a loss from extinguishment of debt in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining fees as of September 30, 2009 are being amortized to interest expense through May 2013. The Company’s $8.3 million Convertible Subordinated Debentures (the “Notes”) have been reduced by debt discounts of $504 and $856 as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The Notes are classified as long-term debt as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, since the earliest that the redemption and repurchase features can occur are in October 2010. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted accounting guidance regarding accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) for its Notes. The impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance is discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes other than cross default provisions. The Company also has various capital lease obligations which are included in long-term debt.

In the third quarter of 2009 the Company issued a total of $1.400 billion of senior notes with maturities of five, six and ten years and used the proceeds to repurchase a substantial portion of its shorter term 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011. In August 2009, the Company sold $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due 201
4 at a price equal to 99.291% of the principal amount and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 at a price equal to 99.247% of the principal amount. In September 2009, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2015 at a price equal to 99.814% of the principal amount and an additional $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 at a price equal to 101.938% of the principal amount. The senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2009 have a covenant package substantially the same as the senior notes and debentures issued in October 2007.The Company used the net cash proceeds from these offerings of $1.395 billion to repurchase a substantial portion of its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011. Simultaneous with the August debt issuance, the Company conducted a cash tender offer to repurchase any and all of the aggregate principal of its $1.500 billion 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011 at a p
urchase price of $1,061.25 per $1,000 of principal. The Company’s repurchase of $1.307 billion of principal pursuant to the tender offer resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $84 million. At September 30, 2009, $193 million of principal remains outstanding on the 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011.At September 30, 2009, the total unamortized net discount related to the fixed rate Senior Notes and Debentures and the discount on the note payable was $24 million and $17 million, respectively. Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2009, the fair market value of the Company’s Senior Notes and Debentures exceeded its carrying value by $294 million. The fair value of the Company’s publicly traded debt was determined utilizing quoted market prices.At September 30, 2009, the outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average interest rate of 0.61% and an average remaining life of less than 30 days. The comme
rcial paper is classified as long-term debt as the Company has the intent and ability, through utilization of its $3.25 billion revolving credit facility due December 2010, to refinance this debt. The Company’s credit facility contains typical covenants for an investment grade company. The one principal financial covenant requires the Company’s interest coverage for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters to be at least 3.0x, which it met at September 30, 2009. As of September 30, 2009, the Company’s interest coverage was approximately 7.1x."

(2) The interest rate at September 25, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was 1.12% and 2.70%, respectively, and was based on the LIBOR rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus a spread. See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for additional information regarding the interest on borrowings under the term loan facility.

See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the CODES, including conditions for conversion.

The discount was recorded as a reduction to the principal amount of the notes and will be amortized as an interest expense over the term of the notes. Interest on the 2009 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2010. The net cash proceeds from this offering amounted to approximately $988 million after deducting the discounts, commissions and estimated expenses, and were used, together with cash on hand, to redeem L-3 Communications’ $750 million 75/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2012 (2002 Notes) on November 2, 2009 and to repay L-3 Communications’ outstanding $650 million term loan on October 7, 2009. In connection with the redemption of the 2002 Notes, the Company will record a debt retirement charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 of approximately $9 million ($6 million after income tax, or $0.05 per diluted share). The 2009 Notes are unsecured senior obligations of L-3 Communications, rank equal in right of payment with all of L-3 Communications’ existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of L-3 Communications’ existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. The 2009 Notes are also guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by each of L-3 Communications’ material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee any of L-3 Communications’ other indebtedness. The 2009 Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to their maturity at the option of L-3 Communications, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (1) 100% of the principal amount, or (2) the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 0.30%. For additional information on the terms of L-3 Communications’ 2009 Notes, including restrictive covenants, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 2, 2009 and the indenture governing the terms of the 2009 Notes, which is filed as an exhibit to this report. On October 23, 2009, L-3 Communications replaced its $1 billion revolving credit facility with a new $1 billion three-year revolving credit facility maturing on October 23, 2012. Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest, at L-3 Communications’ option, at either (i) a “base rate” equal to the higher of (a) 0.50% per annum above the latest federal funds rate, (b) the Bank of America “prime rate” (as defined in the credit agreement), and (c) 1.00% per annum above a “LIBOR rate” (as defined in the credit agreement), plus a spread ranging from 1.25% to 3.00% per annum, or (ii) a “LIBOR rate” (as defined in the credit agreement) plus a spread ranging from 2.25% to 4.00% per annum. The spread, in both cases, depends on L-3 Communications’ debt rating at the time of determination. L-3 Communications pays: (1) commitment fees calculated on the daily amounts of the available unused commitments at a rate ranging from 0.375% to 0.75% per annum, (2) letter of credit fees ranging from 1.50% to 2.67% per annum for performance and commercial letters of credit and (3) letter of credit fees ranging from 2.25% to 4.00% for financial letters of credit. The fee rate, in all cases, depends on L-3 Communications’ debt rating at the time of determination. The debt rating is based on the ratings as determined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings of L-3 Communications’ non-credit enhanced senior, unsecured long-term debt. For additional information on the terms of L-3 Communications’ new $1 billion three-year revolving credit facility, including the financial and other restrictive covenants, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 23, 2009, and the credit agreement governing the terms of the new $1 billion three-year revolving credit facility, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report.

The senior credit agreement, as a
mended in May 2007, provides for a facility of $450,000, and includes a provision which permits future incremental increases of up to $100,000 in total availability under the facility. We can issue up to $450,000 under the letter of credit facility. A portion of the letters of credit issued under the domestic senior credit agreement have performance pricing that is decreased (or increased) as a result of improvements (or reductions) in the credit rating of the domestic senior credit agreement as reported by Moody’s Investors Service and/or Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”). We also have the option to use up to $100,000 of the $450,000 for revolving borrowings at a rate equal to adjusted LIBOR plus 1.50%, subject also to the performance pricing noted above. As a result of the improvement in our S&P credit rating in March 2007, we achieved, and continue to maintain, the lowest possible pricing under the performance pricing provisions of our domestic senior credit agreement. On December 18, 2008, Foster Wheeler AG, Foster Wheeler Ltd., certain of Foster Wheeler Ltd.’s subsidiaries and BNP Paribas, as Administrative Agent, entered into an additional amendment of our domestic senior credit agreement. The amendment includes a consent of the lenders under the credit agreement to the Redomestication. In addition, the amendment reflects the addition of Foster Wheeler AG as a guarantor of the obligations under the credit agreement and reflects changes relating to Foster Wheeler AG becoming the ultimate parent of Foster Wheeler Ltd. and its subsidiaries upon completion of the Redomestication. The amendment became effective upon consummation of the Redomestication on February 9, 2009.
We had approximately $293,500 and $273,500 of letters of credit outstanding under this agreement as of September 30, 2009 and December 26, 2008, respectively. The letter of credit fees ranged from 1.50% to 1.60% of the outstanding amo
unt, excluding a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum. There were no funded borrowings under this agreement as of September 30, 2009 or December 26, 2008.
During the fiscal nine months ended September 30, 2009, one of our subsidiaries based in China, which is 52% owned by us and which we consolidate into our financial statements, repaid its outstanding term loan at the scheduled maturity date. Also during the fiscal nine months ended September 30, 2009, the same China based subsidiary entered into a new term loan for 20 million CNY (approximately $2,926 at the exchange rate in effect at the inception of the term loan) with an interest rate of 4.374% and which matures on January 8, 2010. The estimated fair values of our long-term debt were $226,662 and $227,866 as of September 30, 2009 and December 26, 2008, respectively. We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt (including current installments) based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered for debt of the same remaining maturities."

At September 25, 2009, available borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $965 million after reductions for outstanding letters of credit of $35 million. (2) The interest rate at September 25, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was 1.12% and 2.70%, respectively, and was based on the LIBOR rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus a spread. See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for additional information regarding the interest on borrowings under the term loan facility. Borrowings under the term loan facility were repaid on October 7, 2009 and are classified as a current liability as of September 25, 2009. (3) Under select conditions, including if L-3 Holdings common stock price is more than 120% (currently $120.17) of the then current conversion price (currently $100.14) for a specified period, the conversion feature of the CODES will require L-3 Holdings, upon conversion, to pay the $700 million principal amount in cash, and if the settlement amount exceeds the principal amount, the excess will be settled in cash or stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s option. At the current conversion price of $100.14, the aggregate consideration to be delivered upon conversion would be determined based on 7.0 million shares of L-3 Holdings’ common stock. See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the CODES, including conditions for conversion. L-3’s stock price on October 30, 2009 was $72.29 per share. The effective interest rate on the CODES is 6.33%. Interest expense relates to both the contractual coupon interest and amortization of the discount on the liability components. Interest expense recognized was $11 million and $10 million for the third quarter periods ended September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively, and $31 million and $30 million for the year-to-date periods ended September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively.

The 2009 Notes have an effective interest rate of 5.25% and were issued at a discount of $4 million. The discount was recorded as a reduction to the principal amount of the notes and will be amortized as an interest expense over the term of the notes. Interest on the 2009 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2010. The net cash proceeds from this offering amounted to approximately $988 million after deducting the discounts, commissions and estimated expenses, and were used, together with cash on hand, to redeem L-3 Communications’ $750 million 75/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2012 (2002 Notes) on November 2, 2009 and to repay L-3 Communications’ outstanding $650 million term loan on October 7, 2009. In connection with the redemption of the 2002 Notes, the Company will record a debt retirement charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 of approximately $9 million ($6 million after income tax, or $0.05 per diluted share). The 2009 Notes are unsecured senior obligations of L-3 Communications, rank equal in right of payment with all of L-3 Communications’ existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of L-3 Communications’ existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. The 2009 Notes are also guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by each of L-3 Communications’ material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee any of L-3 Communications’ other indebtedness. The 2009 Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to their maturity at the option of L-3 Communications, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (1) 100% of the principal amount, or (2) the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 0.30%. For additional information on the terms of L-3 Communications’ 2009 Notes, including restrictive covenants, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 2, 2009 and the indenture governing the terms of the 2009 Notes, which is filed as an exhibit to this report. On October 23, 2009, L-3 Communications replaced its $1 billion revolving credit facility with a new $1 billion three-year revolving credit facility maturing on October 23, 2012. Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest, at L-3 Communications’ option, at either (i) a “base rate” equal to the higher of (a) 0.50% per annum above the latest federal funds rate, (b) the Bank of America “prime rate” (as defined in the credit agreement), and (c) 1.00% per annum above a “LIBOR rate” (as defined in the credit agreement), plus a spread ranging from 1.25% to 3.00% per annum, or (ii) a “LIBOR rate” (as defined in the credit agreement) plus a spread ranging from 2.25% to 4.00% per annum. The spread, in both cases, depends on L-3 Communications’ debt rating at the time of determination. L-3 Communications pays: (1) commitment fees calculated on the daily amounts of the available unused commitments at a rate ranging from 0.375% to 0.75% per annum, (2) letter of credit fees ranging from 1.50% to 2.67% per annum for performance and commercial letters of credit and (3) letter of credit fees ranging from 2.25% to 4.00% for financial letters of credit. The fee rate, in all cases, depends on L-3 Communications’ debt rating at the time of determination. The debt rating is based on the ratings as determined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings of L-3 Communications’ non-credit enhanced senior, unsecured long-term debt. For additional information on the terms of L-3 Communications’ new $1 billion three-year revolving credit facility, including the financial and other restrictive covenants, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 23, 2009, and the credit agreement governing the terms of the new $1 billion three-year revolving credit facility, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report.

Represents the weighted
average interest rate in effect at September 30, 2009 for all
borrowings outstanding pursuant to each debt instrument, including
the applicable margin. The interest rates presented represent
stated rates and do not include the impact of our interest rate
derivative agreements, financing costs, discounts or commitment
fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. For
information concerning our derivative instruments, see note
5. (b)
Unused borrowing capacity
represents the maximum availability under the applicable facility
at September 30, 2009 without regard to covenant compliance
calculations. At September 30, 2009, our availability under
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility was limited to
€196.7 million ($288.0 million). Additionally, when the
September 30, 2009 bank reporting requirements have been
completed, we anticipate that our availability under (i) the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility will be limited to
€317.9 million ($465.5 million) and (ii) the
Chellomedia Bank Facility will be limited to
€14.6 million ($21.4 million). To the extent we
were to draw on the VTR Bank Facility (as defined below)
commitments, we would be required to set aside an equivalent amount
of cash collateral. (c)
The fair values of our debt
instruments were determined using the average of applicable bid and
ask prices or, in the case of debt that is not actively traded,
discounted cash flow models. The discount rates used in the
cash flow models are based on the estimated credit spread of each
entity, taking into account market data, to the extent available,
and other relevant factors. (d)
Amounts include the impact
of discounts, where applicable. (e)
The UGC Convertible Notes
are measured at fair value. Our assessment of the fair value of the
UGC Convertible Notes included an estimated credit risk component
of $86.1 million at September 30, 2009. This credit risk
component is estimated as the difference between (i) the fair
value of the UGC Convertible Notes and (ii) the value of the
UGC Convertible Notes derived by holding all other inputs constant
and replacing the market credit spread with a credit spread of nil.
The estimated change in UGC’s credit risk during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2009 resulted in losses of
$25.4 million and $28.9 million, respectively, that are included in
realized and unrealized gains (losses) due to changes in fair
values of certain investments and debt, net, in our condensed
consolidated statements of operations. For information regarding
our fair value measurements, see note 6. (f)
Pursuant to the deposit
arrangements with the lender in relation to VTR’s amended and
restated senior secured credit facility (the VTR Bank Facility), we
are required to fund a cash collateral account in an amount equal
to the outstanding principal and interest under the VTR Bank
Facility. This cash collateral account had a balance of $460.8
million at September 30, 2009, of which $4.7 million is
reflected as a current asset and $456.1 million is presented as a
long-term asset in our condensed consolidated balance
sheet. UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility The UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility, as amended, is the senior secured
credit facility of UPC Broadband Holding. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2009, pursuant to various additional
facility accession agreements, new Facilities Q, R, S, T and U
(collectively, the New Facilities) were executed under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility. Facility Q is a redrawable term
loan facility. Facilities R, S, T and U are non-redrawable term
loan facilities. In connection
with the completion of the New Facilities, certain of the lenders
under the existing Facilities L, M and N novated their commitments
to Liberty Global Europe BV (LG Europe), a direct subsidiary of UPC
Broadband Holding, and entered into the New Facilities. As a
result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, total
commitments of €670.3 million ($981.5 million),
€2,935.8 million ($4,299.0 million) and $500.0 million
under Facilities L, M and N, respectively, were rolled into the New
Facilities, including €70.0 million ($102.5 million) of
commitments under Facility L that were rolled into the New
Facilities during the third quarter of 2009. Among other matters,
the completion of the New Facilities resulted in the extension of a
significant portion of the maturities under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility. Additionally,
during September and October 2009, the committed amounts under
Facility T were increased by $325.0 million through the addition of
a $25.0 million tranche issued at par and a $300.0 million tranche
issued at a discount of 4%. During September 2009, the novation
process was completed with respect to $264.5 million of the new
commitments under Facility T, resulting in net proceeds after
discounts of $254.9 million ($229.2 million of which was received
as of September 30, 2009 with the remainder received in
October 2009). Subsequent to September 30, 2009, the novation
process was completed with respect to the remaining $60.5 million
under Facility T, resulting in additional net proceeds of $58.1
million after discounts. After completion of the foregoing
transactions, total third-party commitments under Facility T were
$876.1 million. Fees and
third-party costs incurred during the first nine months of 2009 in
connection with the partial refinancings of Facilities L, M and N
included $32.4 million related to the completion of Facilities Q
and R and $22.3 million ($2.2 million of which was incurred during
the third quarter of 2009) related to the completion of Facilities
S, T and U. In accordance with applicable guidance,
(i) the fees and third-party costs related to Facilities Q and
R, and a portion of the fees and third-party costs related to
Facility T, were capitalized as deferred financing costs and
(ii) the fees and third-party costs related to Facilities S
and U, and a portion of the fees and third-party costs related to
Facility T, were charged to expense and included in losses on debt
modifications in our condensed consolidated statements of
operations. The details of

Holding Senior Notes On
April 30, 2009, UPC Holding (i) exchanged
€115.3 million ($168.8 million) aggregate principal
amount of its existing 7.75% Senior Notes due 2014, together with a
cash payment of €4.6 million ($6.7 million), and
(ii) €69.1 million ($101.2 million) aggregate
principal amount of its 8.625% Senior Notes due 2014, together with
a cash payment of €4.1 million ($6.0 million), for
€184.4 million ($270.0 million) aggregate principal
amount of new 9.75% Senior Notes due April 2018 (the 9.75% Senior
Notes). In connection with this exchange transaction, UPC Holding
paid the accrued interest on the exchanged Senior Notes and
incurred applicable commissions and fees, including fees paid to
third parties of $5.1 million that are included in losses on debt
modifications in our condensed consolidated statements of
operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2009. On
April 30, 2009, UPC Holding also issued
€65.6 million ($96.1 million) principal amount of
additional 9.75% Senior Notes at an original issue discount of
16.5%, resulting in cash proceeds before commissions and fees of
€54.8 million ($80.2 million). On May 29,
2009, UPC Holding issued €150.0 million ($219.7 million)
principal amount of additional 9.75% Senior Notes at an original
issue discount of 10.853% and $400.0 million principal amount of
new 9.875% Senior Notes due April 2018 (the 9.875% Senior Notes) at
an original issue discount of 7.573%, resulting in cash proceeds
before commissions and fees of €133.7 million ($195.8
million) and $369.7 million, respectively. The net proceeds from
the issuance of the 9.75% and 9.875% Senior Notes, after deducting
applicable commissions and fees, were used for general corporate
purposes. The terms of
the 9.75% and 9.875% Senior Notes are substantially identical
(other than as to interest, maturity and redemption) to the terms
of the existing UPC Holding Senior Notes. At any time
prior to April 15, 2013 in the case of the 9.75% Senior Notes
and April 15, 2014 in the case of the 9.875% Senior Notes, UPC
Holding may redeem some or all of such Senior Notes by paying a
“make-whole” premium, which is the present value of all
scheduled interest payments until April 15, 2013 or 2014, as
the case may be, using the discount rate (as specified in the
applicable indenture) as of the redemption date, plus 50 basis
points. UPC Holding may
redeem some or all of the 9.75% and 9.875% Senior Notes at the
following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the
principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed

any time prior to April 15, 2012, UPC Holding may redeem up to

109.75% and 109.875% of the principal amount, respectively) with
the net proceeds from one or more specified equity offerings. UPC
Holding may redeem all of the 9.75% and 9.875% Senior Notes at
prices equal to their respective principal amounts, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax
law. If UPC Holding or certain of its subsidiaries sell certain
assets or experience specified changes in control, UPC Holding must
offer to repurchase the 9.75% and 9.875% Senior Notes at a
redemption price of 101%. The details of

Credit Facility In June 2009,
Telenet Bidco amended its existing senior credit facility agreement
(the Telenet Credit Facility), whereby the undrawn
€225.0 million ($329.5 million) term loan B2 facility
(the Initial Telenet B2 Facility), which was available to be drawn
up to June 30, 2009, was split into two separate facilities:
(i) a €135.0 million ($197.7 million) term loan
facility (the Telenet Facility B2A), which is available to be drawn
up to and including June 30, 2010, and (ii) a
€90.0 million ($131.8 million) term loan facility (the
Telenet Facility B2B), which was drawn in full on June 29,
2009. The applicable terms and conditions of the Telenet Facility
B2A and the Telenet Facility B2B are the same as the Initial
Telenet B2 Facility. After the completion of this transaction, the
Telenet Credit Facility included Facilities A, B1, B2A, B2B and C,
all of which are term loan facilities, and a revolving loan
facility. On
August 25, 2009, pursuant to various additional facility
accession agreements, new Telenet Facilities D, E1, E2 and F
(collectively, the New Telenet Facilities) were executed under the
Telenet Credit Facility. All of the New Telenet Facilities are
euro-denominated term loan facilities. In connection
with the completion of the New Telenet Facilities, certain of the
lenders under the existing Facilities A, B1, B2A and C novated
their commitments to Telenet Mobile NV (Telenet Mobile), an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Telenet, and entered into the
New Telenet Facilities. As a result, during the third quarter of
2009, total commitments of €452.8 million ($663.1
million), €238.5 million ($349.2 million),
€90.0 million ($131.8 million), €90.0 million
($131.8 million) and €979.2 million ($1,433.9 million)
under Telenet Facilities A, B1, B2A, B2B and C, respectively, were
rolled into the New Telenet Facilities. Among other matters, the
completion of the New Telenet Facilities resulted in the extension
of a significant portion of the maturities under the Telenet Credit
Facility. In addition, to
permit the entry into the New Telenet Facilities, certain
amendments were made to the Telenet Credit Facility and
intercreditor agreement, pursuant to an amendment and waiver
request, which was effective August 25, 2009 (the Amendment
Letter). Pursuant to the Amendment Letter, the Telenet Credit
Facility was also amended to permit certain capital decreases and
related transactions. In connection
with the completion of the New Telenet Facilities described above,
third-party costs aggregating $8.8 million were charged to expense
and are included in losses on debt modifications in our condensed
consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2009. The details of

J:COM Debt In March 2009,
J:COM entered into (i) a ¥15.0 billion ($167.3 million)
variable-rate term loan agreement, of which ¥5.0 billion
($55.8 million) is due in March 2012 and ¥10.0 billion ($111.5
million) is due in March 2015, (ii) a ¥10.0 billion
variable-interest rate term loan agreement due in March 2014,
(iii) a ¥4.0 billion ($44.6 million) variable-interest
rate term loan agreement due in March 2014 and (iv) a
¥1.0 billion ($11.2 million) fixed-interest rate term loan
agreement due in March 2016. All amounts under these
agreements were fully drawn in March 2009 and proceeds were used to
repay borrowings outstanding on certain other J:COM revolving
credit facilities. The interest rate on the new
variable-interest rate loans are based on three-month TIBOR plus a
margin ranging from 0.43% to 0.65%. The new ¥1.0 billion
fixed-interest loan bears interest at 1.85%. These new loan
agreements contain covenants similar to those of J:COM’s
existing credit facilities. On July 2,
2009, J:COM issued ¥10.0 billion ($103.3 million at the
transaction date) principal amount of new unsecured bonds (the
J:COM Bonds). The proceeds from the J:COM Bonds will be used for
general corporate purposes. The J:COM Bonds mature on June 30,
2014 and bear interest at 1.51%. UGC
Convertible Notes In March 2009,
we repurchased €101.0 million ($136.9 million at the
transaction dates) principal amount of the UGC Convertible Notes at
a purchase price equal to 65% of face value, for a total of
€66.4 million ($90.1 million at the transaction dates),
including accrued interest thereon. The $25.9 million change in the
fair value of the repurchased UGC Convertible Notes from
December 31, 2008 through the repurchase dates is included in
realized and unrealized gains (losses) due to changes in fair
values of certain investments and debt, net, in our condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2009. Austar
Bank Facility On
September 17, 2009, Austar Entertainment amended its senior
bank facility (the Austar Bank Facility) to effectively extend the
maturity date of a portion of its existing AUD 225.0 million
($198.9 million) term loan (Tranche A), which was fully drawn at
that date. Under the terms of the amendment, lenders representing
AUD 176.0 million ($155.5 million) of the AUD
225.0 million amount outstanding under Tranche A have agreed
to a “forward start” structure, whereby a new Tranche
A2 was created and will be available to be drawn, at Austar
Entertainment’s option, upon maturity of Tranche A in August
2011. The AUD 49.0 million ($43.3 million) of Tranche A that
was not effectively extended continues to bear interest at AUD BBSY
plus a margin ranging from 0.90% to 1.70% and matures in August
2011. The new Tranche A2 matures in August 2014 and borrowings
under Tranche A2, if drawn, will bear interest at AUD BBSY plus a
margin ranging from 2.80% to 4.00%, depending on Austar’s
leverage ratio at the time of the drawdown. Tranche A2 provides for
an annual commitment fee of 1.0% of the committed Tranche A2 amount
until August 2011. Maturities of Debt and Capital Lease

borrowings with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of the
Company’s debt was greater than its book value by $22.3
million at September 30, 2009 and lower by $556.2 million at
December 31, 2008. On
January 14, 2009, the Company issued $400.0 million of 11.25%
senior notes due February 1, 2019. The net proceeds from the
offering were used to pay down short-term debt. On
August 26, 2009, the Company issued $350.0 million of 8.60%
senior notes due August 15, 2016. The net proceeds from the
offering, along with borrowings under the credit facility and cash
on hand, were used to repurchase $466.4 million of the 5.625%
senior notes due January 15, 2012 and $174.2 million of the
4.95% senior notes due May 15, 2010. These repurchases
resulted in a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $10.3 million,
which is reflected in investment and other expense on the condensed
consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2009.

(577,655) (99,054) $ 2,465,313 $ 2,034,086 10.0% Senior Notes due 2016. In August 2009, we issued senior notes with $800.0 million aggregate principal amount due at maturity for total cash proceeds of about $762.5 million, after deducting original issue discount and commissions. We also incurred $0.8 million in offering expenses related to the issuance of the notes, which we will amortize into interest expense over the term of the notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of NII Capital Corp., a domestic subsidiary that we wholly own, and are guaranteed by us and by our other domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries. These guarantees are full and unconditional, as well as joint and several. Subject to certain exceptions, the notes are equal in rig
ht of payment with any future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of NII Capital Corp. and of the guarantors of the notes, including, but not limited to, with respect to NII Holdings’ guarantee, NII Holdings’ 3.125% convertible notes and NII Holdings’ 2.75% convertible notes. The notes will also be senior to any of NII Capital Corp.’s future subordinated indebtedness. In addition, the notes are effectively subordinated to all NII Capital Corp.’s existing and future secured indebtedness, as well as to all existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes, including the foreign subsidiaries that operate in each of our markets. The notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, beginning on February 15, 2010. The notes will mature on August 15, 2016 when the entire principal amount of $800.0 million will be due. The notes are not entitled to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund. Prior to August 15, 2013, the notes may be redeemed in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest. At any time on or after August 15, 2013 and prior to maturity, the notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices presented below (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on August 15 of the applicable year: Year Redemption
Price 2013.......................................................................................................................................................................... 105.00% 2014.......................................................................................................................................................................... 102.50% 2015 and thereafter............................................................................................................................................... 100.00% Prior to August 15, 2012, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds from specified equity offerings at a redemption price of 110% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Such a redemption may only be made if, after the redemption, at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes issued remains outstanding. Upon the occurrence of specified events involving a change of control, holders of the notes may require us to purchase their notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the notes, among other things, limits our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to: • incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; • create liens or other encumbrances; • place limitations on distributions from some of our subsidiaries; • pay dividends, acquire shares of our capital stock or make investments; • prepay subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments; • issue or sell capital stock of some of our subsidiaries; • issue guarantees; • sell or exchange assets; • enter into transactions with affiliates; and • merge or consolidate with another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Convertible Notes. 3.125% Convertible Notes. The 3.125% notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 8.4517 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, or 10,142,040 aggregate common shares, representing a conversion price of about $118.32 per share. For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009, the closing sale price of our common stock did not exceed 120% of the conversion price of $118.32 per share for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on September 30, 2009. As a result, the conversion contingency was not met as of September 30, 2009. 2.75% Convertible Notes. In accordance with the terms of our 2.75% convertible notes, if the notes are not converted, the noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase the notes in August 2010 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Based on current market conditions, as well as the effective conversion price and trading prices of our 2.75% convertible notes, we believe that the noteholders will require us to repurchase our 2.75% convertible notes. As a result, we classified the $350.0 million repayment of the principal balance of our 2.75% convertible notes due 2025 as current portion of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The 2.75% notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of our common stock at an adjusted conversion rate of 19.967 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, or 6,988,370 aggregate common shares, representing a conversion price of about $50.08 per share. For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009, the closing sale price of our common stock did not exceed 120% of the conversion price of $50.08 per share for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on September 30, 2009. As a result, the conversion contingency was not met as of September 30, 2009. As a result of adopting the FASB’s authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments on January 1, 2009, we were required to separately account for the debt and equity components of our 3.125% convertible notes and our 2.75% convertible notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate. The debt and equity components recognized for our 3.125% convertible notes and our 2.75% convertible notes were as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 3.125% Notes due 2012 2.75% Notes due 2025 3.125% Notes due 2012 2.75% Notes due 2025 Principal amount of convertible notes.................................................. $ 1,200,000 $ 349,996 $ 1,200,000 $ 349,996 Unamortized discount on convertible notes....................................... 111,998 10,543 140,003 19,146 Net carrying amount of convertible notes........................................... 1,088,002 339,453 1,059,997 330,850 Carrying amount of equity component................................................ 194,557 53,253 194,557 53,253 As of September 30, 2009, the unamortized discount on our 3.125% convertible notes and our 2.75% convertible notes had remaining recognition periods of about 32 months and 11 months, respectively. The amount of interest expense recognized on our 3.125% convertible notes and our 2.75% convertible notes and effective interest rates for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 2008 3.125% Notes due 2012 2.75% Notes due 2025 3.125% Notes due 2012 2.75% Notes due 2025 Contractual coupon interest.................................................................. $ 28,125 $ 7,218 $ 28,125 $ 7,218 Amortization of discount on convertible notes.................................. 28,005 8,604 26,136 8,082 Interest expense, net............................................................................... $ 56,130 $ 15,822 $ 54,261 $ 15,300 Effective interest rate on convertible notes......................................... 7.15% 6.45% 7.15% 6.45% Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 2008 3.125% Notes due 2012 2.75% Notes due 2025 3.125% Notes due 2012 2.75% Notes due 2025 Contractual coupon interest.................................................................. $ 9,375 $ 2,406 $ 9,375 $ 2,406 Amortization of discount on convertible notes.................................. 9,514 2,913 8,880 2,736 Interest expense, net............................................................................... $ 18,889 $ 5,319 $ 18,255 $ 5,142 Effective interest rate on convertible notes......................................... 7.15% 6.45% 7.15% 6.45% Syndicated Loan Facilities. In September 2007, Nextel Brazil entered into a $300.0 million syndicated loan facility. Of the total amount of the facility, $45.0 million is denominated in U.S. dollars with a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% (Tranche A — 2.29% and 3.43% as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively). The remaining $255.0 million is denominated in U.S. dollars with a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% (Tranche B — 2.04% and 3.18% as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 20
08, respectively). Tranche A matures on September 14, 2014, and Tranche B matures on September 14, 2012. In addition, a portion of Nextel Mexico’s syndicated loan facility bears a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. The interest rate on the portions of both the Brazil and Mexico syndicated loan facilities that have interest rates based on LIBOR are reset each quarter. Brazil Import Financing. In March 2009, Nextel Brazil began financing certain handset equipment purchased mainly from Motorola and Research in Motion, or RIM, that is imported into Brazil through agreements with several Brazilian banks. Each tranche of these financings matures within a six to twelve-month period. Brazil Credit Paper. In May 2009, Nextel Brazil entered into a $25.6 million working capital loan with a Brazilian bank.

mp;#160; (a) The bank credit agreements, commercial paper program and public debt of the Company rank pari passu with the senior debt of the respective obligors thereon. The Company’s maturity profile of its outstanding debt and other financing arrangements is relatively long-term, with a weighted average maturity of 11.0 years as of September 30, 2009.(b) Represents the portion of committed capacity reserved for outstanding and undrawn letters of credit.(c) Represents principal amounts adjusted for premiums and discounts. The weighted-average interest rate on Time Warner’s total debt was 6.41% at September 30, 2009 and 5.51% at December 31, 2008. The Company’s public debt matures as follows: $2.000 billion in 2009, $0 in 2010, $2.000 billion in 2011, $2.000 billion in 2012, $1.300 billion in 2013 and $10.031 billion thereafter.(d) Amount consists of capital lease and other obligations, including committed financings by subsidiaries under local bank credit agreements.Repayment and Termination of $2.0 Billion Term FacilityOn March 17, 2009, the Company used a portion of the proceeds it received from the Special Dividend to repay in full the $2.0 billion outstanding (plus accrued interest) under its unsecured term loan facility with a maturity date of January 8, 2011 (the “Term Facility”) and terminated the Term Facility. Time Warner did not incur any early termination or prepayment penalties in connection with the termination of the Term Facility.Termination of Supplemental Credit AgreementOn March 12, 2009, TWC borrowed the full committed amount of $1.932 billion under its unsecured term loan credit facility entered into on June 30, 2008 (the &
amp;#8220;TWC Bridge Facility”), all of which was used by TWC to pay a portion of the Special Dividend. On March 26, 2009, TWC completed an offering of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities and used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to prepay in full the outstanding loans and all other amounts due under the TWC Bridge Facility, and the TWC Bridge Facility was terminated in accordance with its terms. Concurrently with the termination of the TWC Bridge Facility and pursuant to the terms of the $1.535 billion credit agreement (the “Supplemental Credit Agreement”) between the Company (as lender) and TWC (as borrower) for a two-year senior unsecured supplemental term loan facility (the “Supplemental Credit Facility”), on March 26, 2009, TWC terminated the commitments of Time Warner under the Supplemental Credit Facility, and the Supplemental Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms.A
mendments to Revolving FacilityOn March 11, 2009, the Company entered into the first and second amendments to the amended and restated credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) for its senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”). The first amendment terminated the $100 million commitment of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (“LCPI”), a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in September 2008, reducing the committed amount of the Revolving Facility from $7.0 billion to $6.9 billion. The second amendment, among other things, amended the Revolving Credit Agreement to (i) expand the circumstances under which any other lender under the Revolving Facility would become a Defaulting Lender (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended) and (ii) permit Time Warner to terminate the commitment of any such lender on terms substantially similar to those applicable to LCPI under the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement. Consent SolicitationOn April 15, 2009, the Company completed a solicitation of consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) from the holders of the debt securities (the “Securities”) issued by Time Warner Inc. and its subsidiaries under all of the indentures governing the publicly traded debt securities of the Company and its subsidiaries other than the indenture entered into in November 2006 (collectively, the “Indentures”). Completion of the Consent Solicitation resulted in the adoption on April 16, 2009 of certain amendments to each Indenture that provide that certain restrictive covenants will not apply (subject to the concurrent or prior issuance of the guarantee by HBO discussed below) to a conveyance or transfer by AOL LLC of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety, unless such conveyance or transfer constitutes a conveyance or transfer of the properties and assets of the issuer and the guarantors under the relevant Indenture and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, substantially as an entirety. As a result of the Consent Solicitation, prior to or concurrent with a conveyance or transfer of AOL LLC’s properties and assets substantially as an entirety, HBO will issue a guarantee of the obligations of Historic TW Inc. (“Historic TW”) (including in its capacity as successor to Time Warner Companies, Inc.), whether as issuer or guarantor, under the Indentures and the Securities. Such guarantee will be issued by HBO only in connection with such a transaction.Shelf Registration StatementTime Warner had a shelf registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) on file with the SEC since November 8, 2006 that allowed it to offer and sell from time to t
ime debt securities, preferred stock, common stock and/or warrants to purchase debt and equity securities. As a result of the Company’s $13.955 billion of unused committed capacity at March 31, 2009 and the anticipated expiration in early November 2009 of the Registration Statement, the Company determined it no longer needed the Registration Statement. Accordingly, on April 24, 2009, the Company and the subsidiary guarantors under the Registration Statement submitted filings to the SEC that suspended the reporting obligations with respect to the debt securities (and related guarantees) that were offered and sold pursuant to the Registration Statement and deregistered the securities covered under the Registration Statement that were available for offer and sale."

Long-term and Short-term Debt The following represents significant changes in debt from the amounts reported in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2008 Annual Report. Senior Notes In May 2009, the Holding Company issued $1,250 million senior notes due June 1, 2016. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75%, payable semiannually. In connection with the offering, the Holding Company incurred $6 million of issuance costs which have been capitalized and included in other assets. These costs are being amortized over the term of the notes. In March 2009, the Holding Company issued $397 million of floating rate senior notes due June 29, 2012 under the FDIC Program. The notes bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR, reset quarterly, plus 0.32%. The notes are not redeemable prior to their maturity. In connection with the offering, the Holding Company incurred $15 million of issuance costs which have been capitalized and included in other assets. These costs are being amortized over the term of the notes. In February 2009, the Holding Company closed the successful remarketing of the $1,035 million Series B portion of the junior subordinated debt securities constituting part of its common equity units issued in June 2005. The common equity units consisted of a debt security and a stock purchase contract under which the holders of the units would be required to purchase common stock. The remarketing of the Series A portion of the junior subordinated debt securities and the associated stock purchase contract settlement occurred in August 2008. In the February 2009 remarketing, the Series B junior subordinated debt securities were modified, as permitted by their terms, to be 7.717% senior debt securities Series B, due February 15, 2019. The Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their junior subordinated debt securities remarketed and used the remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under the stock purchase contracts. For those common equity unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment obligations under the stock purchase contracts, the terms of the debt they received are the same as the terms of the remarketed debt. The subsequent settlement of the stock purchase contracts provided proceeds to the Holding Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of the Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company delivered 24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common stock to settle the stock purchase contracts on February 17, 2009. Repurchase Agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York MetLife Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds $122 million and $89 million of common stock of the FHLB of NY at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, which is included in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also entered into repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby MetLife Bank has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket lien on certain of MetLife Bank’s residential mortgages, mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to collateralize MetLife Bank’s obligations under the repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank maintains control over these pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The repurchase agreements and the related security agreement represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of default by MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is limited to the amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the outstanding repurchase agreements. The amount of MetLife Bank’s liability for repurchase agreements entered into with the FHLB of NY was $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, which is included in long-term debt and short-term debt depending upon the original tenor of the advance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, MetLife Bank received advances related to long-term borrowings totaling $950 million and $945 million, respectively, from the FHLB of NY. MetLife Bank made repayments to the FHLB of NY of $220 million and $171 million related to long-term borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The advances on the repurchase agreements related to both long-term and short-term debt were collateralized by residential mortgages, mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of $4.4 billion and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Collateralized Borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York MetLife Bank is a depository institution that is approved to use the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Discount Window borrowing privileges and participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Term Auction Facility. In order to utilize these facilities, MetLife Bank has pledged qualifying loans and investment securities to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as collateral. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, MetLife Bank’s liability for advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under these facilities was $1.2 billion and $950 million, respectively, which is included in short-term debt. The estimated fair value of loan and investment security collateral pledged by MetLife Bank to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $2.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on these advances was 0.19%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the average daily balance of these advances was $1.9 billion and these advances were outstanding for an average of 23 days. The Company did not participate in these programs during the nine months ended September 30, 2008. Short-term Debt Short-term debt was $2.1 billion and $2.7 billion at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At September 30, 2009, short-term debt consisted of $340 million of commercial paper, $1.2 billion related to the aforementioned collateralized borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and $590 million related to MetLife Bank’s liability under the aforementioned repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY with original maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2008, short-term debt consisted of $714 million of commercial paper, $950 million related to the aforementioned collateralized borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, $695 million related to MetLife Bank’s liability under the aforementioned repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY with original maturities of less than one year and $300 million related to MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut’s liability for borrowings from the FHLB of Boston with original maturities of less than one year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, the weighted average interest rate on short-term debt was 0.44% and 2.6%, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, the average daily balance of short-term debt was $3.4 billion and $808 million, respectively, and short-term debt was outstanding for an average of 15 days and 31 days, respectively.

Credit Facilities In June 2009, the Company elected to amend its domestic syndicated revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) that is scheduled to mature in December 2011. As part of the amendment, the Company reduced the size of the Credit Facility to the lesser of: (1) $1.5 billion, or (2) an amount determined based on eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory.

Interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Convertible Notes were issued under ATI’s shelf registration statement and are not listed on any national securities exchange. Net proceeds of $390.2 million from the sale of the Convertible Notes were used to make a $350 million voluntary cash contribution to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes including funding of contributions to trusts established to fund retiree medical benefits. The Convertible Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and equally ranked with all of its existing and future senior unsecured debt. The underwriting fees and other third-party expenses for the issuance of the Convertible Notes were $12.3 million and will be amortized to interest expense over the 5-year term of the Convertible Notes.The Company does not have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to the stated maturity date. Holders of the Convertible Notes have the option to convert their notes into sh
ares of ATI common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date (June 1, 2014). The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 23.9263 shares of ATI common stock per $1,000 (in whole dollars) principal amount of notes (9,630,336 shares), equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $41.795 per share, subject to adjustment, as defined in the Convertible Notes. Other than receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares, holders do not have the option to receive cash instead of shares of common stock upon conversion. Accrued and unpaid interest that exists upon conversion of a note will be deemed paid by the delivery of shares of ATI common stock and no cash payment or additional shares will be given to holders.If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the Convertible Notes, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100% of the p
rincipal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Such a repurchase will be made in cash.2019 NotesIn June 2009, the Company issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.375% unsecured Senior Notes with a maturity of June 2019 (the “2019 Notes”). Interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 2019 Notes were issued under ATI’s shelf registration statement and are not listed on any national securities exchange. Net proceeds of $344.2 million from the sale of the 2019 Notes were used to retire $183.3 million of the Company’s 2011 Notes, as discussed below, and for general corporate purposes. The underwriting fees, discount, and other third-party expenses for the issuance of the 2019 Notes were $5.8 million and will be amortized to interest expense over the 10-year term of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and equally ranked with all of its existing and future senior unsecured debt. The 2019 Notes restrict the Company’s ability to create certain liens, to enter into sale leaseback transactions, and to consolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of its assets. The Company has the option to redeem the 2019 Notes, as a whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice to the holders of the Notes at a redemption price specified in the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes are subject to repurchase upon the occurrence of a change in control repurchase event (as defined in the 2019 Notes) at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2019 Notes repurchased.Retirement of 2011 NotesIn June 2009, the Company completed a tender offer for t
he Company’s 8.375% Notes due in 2011 (the “2011 Notes”) of which $300 million in aggregate principal amount was outstanding prior to the tender offer. As a result of the tender offer, the Company retired $183.3 million of the 2011 Notes and recognized a pre-tax charge of $9.2 million in the 2009 second quarter for the costs of acquiring the 2011 Notes. As of September 30, 2009, $116.7 million in face value of the 2011 Notes remain outstanding. Amendment to Unsecured Credit Agreement In May 2009, the Company amended its $400 million domestic bank group credit agreement to redefine the two financial covenants to provide additional financial flexibility. The amendment restates the definition of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes, and consolidated earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization as used in the interest coverage and leverage ratios to exclude any non-cash pension expense or income and restates the defini
tion of consolidated indebtedness used in the leverage ratio, which previously was based on gross indebtedness, to be net of cash on hand in excess of $50 million. As of September 30, 2009, there had been no borrowings made under the facility, although a portion of the facility was used to support approximately $10 million in letters of credit. The Company has an additional separate credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit. As of September 30, 2009, $30 million in letters of credit was outstanding under this facility.In addition, STAL, the Company’s Chinese joint venture company in which ATI has a 60% interest, had approximately $4 million in letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2009 related to the expansion of its operations in Shanghai, China. These letters of credit are supported solely by STAL’s financial capability without any guarantees from the joint venture partners.

Note 6. Derivative Financial Instruments and HedgingAs part of its risk management strategy, the Company, from time-to-time, utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in raw material prices, energy costs, foreign currencies, and interest rates. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company accounts for all of these contracts as hedges. In general, hedge effectiveness is determined by examining the relationship between offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the item being hedged, and the financial instrument being used for the hedge. Effectiveness is measured utilizing regression analysis and other techniques to determine whether the change in the fair market value or cash flows of the derivative exceeds the change in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item. Calculated ineffectiveness, if any, is immediately recognized on the statement of operations. The Company sometimes uses futures and swap contracts to manage exposure to changes in prices for forecasted purchases of raw materials, such as nickel, and natural gas. Generally under these contracts, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the price of the item being hedged is fixed at the time that the contract is entered into and the Company is obligated to make or receive a payment equal to the net change between this fixed price and the market price at the date the contract matures.The majority of ATI’s products are sold utilizing raw material surcharges and index mechanisms. However, as of September 30, 2009, the Company had entered into financial hedging arrangements primarily at the request of its customers, related to firm orders, for approximately 5% of the Company’s total annual nickel requirements through 2010
. Any gain or loss associated with these hedging arrangements is included in the selling price to the customer requesting the hedge over the designated hedge period. At September 30, 2009, the outstanding financial derivatives used to hedge the Company’s exposure to natural gas cost volatility represented approximately 50% of its forecasted requirements through 2011.While the majority of the Company’s direct export sales are transacted in U.S. dollars, foreign currency exchange contracts are used, from time-to-time, to limit transactional exposure to changes in currency exchange rates for those transactions denominated in a non-U.S. currency. The Company sometimes purchases foreign currency forward contracts that permit it to sell specified amounts of foreign currencies expected to be received from its export sales for pre-established U.S. dollar amounts at specified dates. The forward contracts are denominated in the same foreign curren
cies in which export sales are denominated. These contracts are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows of a portion of the forecasted future export sales transactions which otherwise would expose the Company to foreign currency risk. At September 30, 2009, the outstanding financial derivatives used to hedge the Company’s exposure to foreign currency, primarily euros, represented approximately 6% of our forecasted total international sales through 2011. In addition, the Company may also designate cash balances held in foreign currencies as hedges of forecasted foreign currency transactions. The Company may enter into derivative interest rate contracts to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed- and floating-rate debt. There were no unsettled derivative financial instruments related to debt balances for the periods presented, although previously settled contracts remain a component of the recorded value of debt. See Note 4. Debt, for further information.&l
t;br />The fair values of the Company’s derivative financial instruments are presented below. All fair values for these derivatives were measured using Level 2 information as defined by the accounting standard hierarchy, which includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.(in millions): September 30, December 31,Asset derivatives Balance sheet location 2009 2008 Nickel and other raw material contracts Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 10.9 $ 7.0 Foreign exchange contracts Prepaid expenses and other current assets 2.1 - Natural gas contracts Prepaid expenses and other current assets 0.2 - Foreign exchange contracts Other assets 2.4 10.2 Nickel and other raw material contracts Other assets 2.2 - Total asset derivatives $ 17.8 $

Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current period results. The Company did not use fair value or net investment hedges for the periods presented.Activity with regard to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 was as follows (in millions): Amount of Gain (Loss) Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Amount of Gain Reclassified from on Derivatives (Ineffective&

ansactions. Since these derivative contracts represent hedges, the net effect of any gain or loss on results of operations may be fully or partially offset.There are no credit risk-related contingent features in the Company’s derivative contracts, and the contracts contained no provisions under which the Company has posted, or would be required to post, collateral. The counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts were substantial and creditworthy commercial banks that are recognized market makers. The Company controls its credit exposure by diversifying across multiple counterparties and by monitoring credit ratings and credit default swap spreads of its counterparties. The Company also enters into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible.
Note 7. Income Taxes A $1.4 million tax benefit was recognized during the third quarter 2009. This resulted from an effective tax rate of 39.6% reduced by an income tax benefit of $2.4 million for adjustment of taxes paid in a prior year. The third quarter 2008 included an income tax provision of $83.9 million, or 36.3% of income before tax. For the first nine months of 2009, the provision for income taxes was $5.3 million compared to $243.0 million, or 34.5% of income before tax, for the first nine months of 2008. The 2009 provision included a non-recurring tax charge of $11.5 million, primarily associated with the tax consequences of the June 2009 $350 m
illion voluntary contribution to the pension plan partially offset by net discrete income tax benefit adjustments of $7.3 million associated with prior years’ taxes. Primarily as a result of the $350 million voluntary pension contribution in June 2009 which was designated to pertain to the 2008 tax year, the Company received a U.S. Federal income tax refund of $108.5 million in the 2009 second quarter.
Note 8. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe Company has defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees. Benefits under the defined benefit pension plans are generally based on years of service and/or final average pay. The Company funds the U.S. pension plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code. In June 2009, the Company made a $350 million voluntary cash contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan to improve the plan’s funded position. The Company also sponsors several postretirement plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees. The plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. In most plans, C
ompany contributions towards premiums are capped based on the cost as of a certain date, thereby creating a defined contribution. For the non-collectively bargained plans, the Company maintains the right to amend or terminate the plans at its discretion. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, the components of pension (income) expense and components of other postretirement benefit expense for the Company’s defined benefit plans included the following (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Pension Benefits: Service cost - benefits earned during the year$ 5.6 $ 7.1 $ 17.7 $ 21.1 Interest cost on benefits earned in prior years 34.8 32.6 103.7 97.9 Expected return on plan assets (42.1) (50.3) (114.0) (150.7)Amortization of prior service cost 4.1 4.3 12.3 12.6 Amortization of net actuarial loss 17.4 3.3 59.2 9.8 Total pension (income) expense$ 19.8 $ (3.0) $ 78.9 $ (9.3) Three Months Ended Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,September 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Other Postretirement Benefits: Service cost - benefits earned during the year$ 0.7 $ 0.8

For 2008, other postretirement costs for a defined contribution plan were $2.3 million and $5.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively.

amp;#160; Retirement benefit expense represents defined benefit plan pension expense, and other postretirement benefit expense for both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Operating profit with respect to the Company’s business segments excludes any retirement benefit expense. Corporate expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2009 were $15.7 million, compared to $13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008. This increase is due primarily to higher expenses associated with long-term performance-based incentive compensation programs. Other expense, net of gains on asset sales, primarily includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations and other non-operating income or expense. These items are prese
nted primarily in selling and administrative expenses and in other expense in the statement of operations. These items resulted in net charges of $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008. The decrease in the quarter was primarily related to lower expenses at closed operations. For the nine months ended 2009, other expense, net of gains on asset sales, was $7.5 million, compared to $6.7 million for the prior year period. This increase on a year to date basis was primarily related to lower foreign currency gains, and higher franchise and other non-income related taxes.
Note 10. Financial Information for Subsidiary and Guarantor Parent The payment obligations under the $150 million 6.95% debentures due 2025 issued by Allegheny Ludlum Corporation (the “Subsidiary”) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (the “Guarantor Parent”). In accordance with positions established by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following financial information sets forth separately financial information with respect to the Subsidiary, the non-guarantor subsidiaries and the Guarantor Parent. The principal elimination entries eliminate investments in subsidiaries and certain intercompany balances and transactions. Investments in subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation, are included in other assets on the balance sheets. Allegheny Technologies is the plan sponsor for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) which covers certain current and former employees of the Subsidiary and the non-guarantor subsidiaries. As a result, the balance sheets presented for the Subsidiary and the non-guarantor subsidiaries do not include any Plan assets or liabilities, or the related deferred taxes. The Plan assets, liabilities and related deferred taxes and pension income or expense are recognized by the Guarantor Parent. Management and royalty fees charged to the Subsidiary and to the non-guarantor subsidiaries by the Guarantor Parent have been excluded solely for purposes of this presentation. Cash flows related to intercompany activity between the Guarantor Parent, the Subsidiary, and the non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented as financing activities on the condensed stateme

Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and disposal of wastes, and which may require that it investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. The Company could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or noncompliance with environmental permits required at its facilities. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of its current and former sites, as well as third party sites. Environmental liabilities are recorded when the Company’s liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable. In many cases, however, the Company is not able to determine whether it is liable or, if liability is probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. Estimates of the Company’s liability remain subject to additional uncertainties, including the nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the number, participation, and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”). The Company expects that it will adjust its accruals to reflect new information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in a given period, but the Company cannot re
liably predict the amounts of such future adjustments. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the sites with which the Company is currently associated (either individually or in the aggregate) will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell the Company’s securities. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. At September 30, 2009, the Company’s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled approximately $17 million, of which $8 million was included in other current liabilities. The reserve includes estimated probable future costs of $5 million for federal Superfund and comparable state-managed sites; $6 million for formerly owned or operated sites for which the Company has remediation or indemnification obligations; $3 million for owned or controlled sites at which Company operations have been discontinued; and $3 million for sites utilized by the Company in its ongoing operations. The Company continues to evaluate whether it may be able to recover a portion of future costs for environmental liabilities from third parties. The timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site. The Company expects that it will expend present accruals over many years and that remediation of all sites with which it has been identified will be completed within thirty years. &a
mp;#160; See Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 for a discussion of legal proceedings affecting the Company. A number of other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against the Company relating to the conduct of its currently and formerly owned businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, commercial, government contract work, employment, employee benefits, taxes, environmental, health and safety, occupational disease, and stockholder matters. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to the Company, management does not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations for that period.
Note 12. Subsequent Event On October 23, 2009, the Company acquired the assets of Crucible Compaction Metals and Crucible Research, a western Pennsylvania producer of advanced powder metal products, for $40.95 million. This business has been named ATI Powder Metals and will be part of the High Performance Metals business segment.

3,2009-11-04,849399,XBRL,"Note 4. Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments As of April 4, 2009, we adopted new authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments, which requires issuers of certain types of convertible notes to separately account for the liability and equity components of such convertible notes in a manner that reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. This guidance applies to the 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011 and the 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013, collectively referred to as the Senior Notes. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, the liability of the Senior Notes was carried at its principal value and only the contract
ual interest expense was recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because this guidance requires retrospective adoption, we were required to adjust all periods for which the Senior Notes were outstanding before the date of adoption. Upon adoption of the new authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments and effective as of the issuance date of the Senior Notes, we recorded $586 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 6.78% at the time of issuance and the coupon rate of the Senior Notes. This debt discount, recorded in additional paid-in capital, is amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the contractual terms of the Senior Notes using the effective interest method. In addition, we allocated $9 million of the issuance costs to the equity component of the Senior N
otes and the remaining $24 million of the issuance costs to the debt component of the Senior Notes. The issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the relative carrying amounts of the debt and equity components. The $24 million of debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component is amortized as interest expense over the respective contractual terms of the Senior Notes using the effective interest method. Each $1,000 of principal of the Senior Notes will initially be convertible into 52.2951 shares of Symantec common stock, which is the equivalent of $19.12 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. As of October 2, 2009, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the discount and debt issuance costs is approximately 3 years and the if-converted value of the Senior Notes does not exceed the principal amount o
f the Senior Notes. The following table presents information regarding the equity and liability components of the Senior Notes: As of October 2, 2009 April 3, 2009 As Adjusted (In millions) Equity component of Senior Notes..................................................................................................................................... $ 586 $ 586 Principal amount of Senior Notes........................................................................................................................................ $ 2,100 $ 2,100 Unamortized discount of Senior Notes...............................................................................................................................

NOTE 11. INDEBTEDNESS During the first quarter of 2009, we repaid $325 million principal amount of our 6.25% notes, which matured on January 15, 2009, and $200 million principal amount of our 6.00% notes, which matured on February 15, 2009. On March 30, 2009, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2009 Credit Agreement”) for a committed $500 million revolving credit facility that expires in March 2010. At September 30, 2009, we had $1.0 billion of committed revolving credit facilities with commercial banks. In addition to the 2009 Credit Agreement, there is a $500 million committed revolving credit facility which expires on July 7, 2012. Both facilities contain certain covenants which, among other things, require the maintenance of a funded indebtedness to total capitalization ratio (a defined formula per each agreement), restrict certain merger transactions or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a significant subsidiary and limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the facilities may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the facilities, covenant defaults and other customary defaults. At September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of both committed credit facilities. There were no direct borrowings under the committed credit facilities during the quarter ended or outstanding as of September 30, 2009. We also have an outstanding commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time up to $1.0 billion in commercial paper with maturity of no more than 270 days. To the extent we have commercial paper outstanding, our ability to borrow under the facilities is reduced. At September 30, 2009, we had no commercial paper outstanding. "

Financing
Transactions Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loan—As of September 30,
2009, the Company had $625.0 million outstanding under its $1.25
billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Revolving
Credit Facility) and had approximately $4.7 million of undrawn
letters of credit outstanding. In March 2008, the Company increased
its borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility by
adding $325.0 million of term loan commitments (Term Loan). As of
September 30, 2009, the Term Loan was fully drawn. The Company
continues to maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts
under the Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary
course. 7.25% Senior
Notes Offering—On June 10, 2009, the Company
completed an institutional private placement of $300.0 million
aggregate principal amount of its 7.25% senior unsecured notes due
2019 (7.25% Notes). The net proceeds to the Company from the
offering were approximately $291.6 million, after deducting
commissions and expenses. The Company used $210.2 million of the
net proceeds to finance the repurchase of its outstanding 7.50%
notes due 2012 (7.50% Notes) through a cash tender offer. In
addition, the Company used $50.0 million of the net proceeds to
repay certain of its outstanding indebtedness incurred under its
Revolving Credit Facility. The 7.25% Notes
mature on May 15, 2019, and interest is payable semiannually
in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year,
commencing November 15, 2009, to the persons in whose names
the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding
May 1 and November 1, respectively. The Company may
redeem the 7.25% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, together
with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes
will accrue from June 10, 2009 and will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months. If the Company
undergoes a change of control and ratings decline, each as defined
in the indenture for the 7.25% Notes, the Company may be required
to repurchase all of the 7.25% Notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and additional interest, if any, to but not including the date
of repurchase. The 7.25% Notes rank equally with all of the
Company’s other senior unsecured debt and are structurally
subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other
obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries. The indenture
contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s
ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and the
Company’s and its subsidiaries’ abilities to incur
liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions,
including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur liens on
assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the
aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA
as defined in the indenture. Tender Offer
for and Redemption of 7.50% Senior Notes—During the nine
months ended September 30, 2009, the Company repurchased
$204.2 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes
pursuant to a cash tender offer. The Company paid $210.2 million,
including approximately $1.7 million in accrued and unpaid
interest, to holders of the 7.50% Notes using net proceeds from the
institutional private placement of the 7.25% Notes discussed above.
On July 20, 2009, the Company completed the redemption of the
remaining $20.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50%
Notes. In accordance with the redemption provisions and the
indenture for the 7.50% Notes, the remaining 7.50% Notes were
redeemed at a price equal to 101.875% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, July 20,
2009, for an aggregate purchase price of $21.5 million. Upon
completion of this redemption, none of the 7.50% Notes remained
outstanding. The Company recorded a charge of $6.4 million related
to amounts paid in excess of carrying value and the write-off of
deferred financing fees, which is reflected in loss on retirement
of long-term obligations in the accompanying condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2009. Redemption
of 3.00% Convertible Notes—During the nine months ended
September 30, 2009, the Company issued a notice for the
redemption of the remaining $162.2 million aggregate principal
amount of its 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012
(3.00% Notes). In accordance with the conversion provisions and the
indenture for the 3.00% Notes, holders of the 3.00% Notes had the
right at any time up to and including, but not after the close of
business on August 26, 2009, to convert their 3.00% Notes into
shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (Common
Stock) at a conversion rate of 48.7805 shares per $1,000 principal
amount of notes. Holders of approximately $162.1 million of the
3.00% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 7,908,316
shares of Common Stock prior to redemption. In accordance with the
redemption provisions and the indenture for the 3.00% Notes, the
remaining 3.00% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 101.125% of
the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but
excluding, August 27, 2009, for an aggregate purchase price of
$0.1 million. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 3.00%
Notes remained outstanding. Stock
Repurchase Program—During the nine months ended
September 30, 2009, the Company repurchased an aggregate of
5.9 million shares of its Common Stock for an aggregate of
$187.2 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to its
$1.5 billion stock repurchase program approved by the
Company’s Board of Directors in February 2008 (2008 Buyback).
Between October 1, 2009 and October 23, 2009, the Company
repurchased an additional 0.02 million shares of its Common
Stock for an aggregate of $0.8 million, including commissions and
fees. As of October 23, 2009, the Company had repurchased a
total of 19.9 million shares of Common Stock for an aggregate
of $721.3 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the
2008 Buyback. Under the 2008
Buyback, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to
time through open market purchases or privately negotiated
transactions at prevailing prices in accordance with securities
laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions
and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, the Company purchases
its Common Stock pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the
Exchange Act, which allows the Company to repurchase shares during
periods when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under
insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout
periods. In the near term, the Company expects to fund any further
repurchases of its Common Stock through a combination of cash on
hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under its
Revolving Credit Facility. Purchases under the 2008 Buyback are
subject to the Company having available cash to fund
repurchases. "

10. Debt During the second quarter of 2009, the Company repaid $62.0 million related to a 40 million British pound borrowing under the revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due September 2015 and $160 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.08% senior notes due September 2018. The second funding date occurred in December 2008 for $100 million, consisting of $35 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.69% senior notes due December 2015 and $65 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.18% senior notes due December 2018. The senior notes carry a weighted average interest rate of 6.93%. The senior notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain debt to EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s revolving credit facility. In July 2008, the Company repaid the $225 million 7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using the proceeds from borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility. Also in July 2008, the Company obtained the second funding of $80 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July 2018 under the third quarter of 2007 private placement agreement which completed the sale of $450 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. The first funding occurred in December 2007 for $370 million, consisting of $270 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The $100 million accounts receivable securitization facility was not renewed by the Company in May 2009. "

At September 30, 2009, we had $152 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding and no borrowings outstanding under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility. TPDI Credit Facilities—In October 2008, TPDI entered into a credit agreement for a $1.190 billion secured term loan and a $75 million revolving credit facility (together, the “TPDI Credit Facilities”). The TPDI Credit Facilities will finance the construction of Dhirubhai Deepwater KG1 and Dhirubhai Deepwater KG2.

Upon conversion, we are required to deliver, in lieu of shares, cash up to the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted and shares in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. The Redomestication Transaction triggered the right of holders to convert the convertible notes at any time from December 3, 2008 through February 3, 2009. During the conversion period, we received conversion notices with respect to $490,000 principal amount of convertible notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, as a result of these conversions, we paid an aggregate amount of $150,000 and recognized a gain on the retirement of debt of $247,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $615 million of the 1.625% Series A Convertible Senior Notes for an aggregate cash payment of $581 million. We recognized a loss of $16 million associated with the debt component of the instrument and recorded additional paid-in capital of $18 million associated with the equity component of the instrument.

tible debt instruments. Debt issue costs, recorded in other assets, decreased $23 million, representing the cumulative adjustment caused by increased amortization recognized in interest expense for the two years ended December 31, 2008 due to the reduced recognition period required by the accounting standards update regarding convertible debt instruments and the portion of debt issue costs reclassified to additional paid-in capital. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles was $9 million, recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008, from the retrospective increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007.

As of September 30, 2009, no shares were issuable upon conversion of any series of the Convertible Senior Notes since the closing price per share did not exceed the conversion price of $168.61 during the previous 30 trading days.

$55.7 million held in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031
exchange escrow account with a qualified intermediary, for cash
available of $116.9 million, net of amounts outstanding on our
unsecured revolving credit facilities. The principal
amounts due at maturity above reflect our intent to extend $9.4
million of 2009 maturities to 2010 pursuant to our extension
options with the lenders. As of
September 30, 2009, our joint venture partners’ share of
total debt was $159.9 million.
Unsecured Revolving
Credit Facilities In March 2009, we amended
the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities to, among
other things, extend the maturity of a portion of the borrowing
capacity thereunder to April 26, 2012. In connection with the
amendments, we increased our aggregate borrowing capacity under the
unsecured revolving credit facilities to $867.0 million, of which
$277.0 million matures on April 26, 2010 and $590.0 million
matures in 2012 (the “2012 capacity”). The U.S. credit
facility also includes an “accordion” feature that
permits us to further expand our aggregate borrowing capacity to
$1.0 billion upon satisfaction of certain
conditions. In November 2009, we
received commitments from two financial institutions that increased
our 2012 capacity by $125.0 million, to $715.0 million from $590.0
million. The commitments also increased our aggregate borrowing
capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facilities to $965.0
million. These commitments have closed, and the borrowing capacity
under these commitments is currently available to
us. Borrowings under our
unsecured revolving credit facilities bear interest at a
fluctuating rate per annum (based on U.S. or Canadian LIBOR, the
Canadian Bankers’ Acceptance rate, or the U.S. or Canadian
Prime rate), plus an applicable percentage based on our
consolidated leverage. At September 30, 2009, the applicable
percentage was 0.75% for 2010 maturities and 2.80% for 2012
maturities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities have a 20
basis point facility fee.
Senior Notes
Offering In April 2009,
we completed the sale of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount
of 6 1/2% senior notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) of
Ventas Realty and a wholly owned subsidiary, Ventas Capital
Corporation (“Ventas Capital” and together with Ventas
Realty, the “Issuers”), at a 15 3/4% discount to par value, and received net proceeds of
$166.0 million. The 2016 Notes
are substantially similar in all respects to the Issuers’
other 6 1/2% senior notes due 2016, except that the 2016 Notes were
issued with original issue discount and, thus, are a separate
series from, and have a different CUSIP number than, the other
notes. Debt Repayments,
Purchases and Tender Offers During the nine
months ended September 30, 2009, we purchased in open market
transactions and/or through cash tender offers $361.6 million of
our senior notes composed of: $121.6 million principal amount of
our outstanding 6 3/4% senior notes due 2010, $109.4 million principal amount
of our outstanding 9% senior notes due 2012, $103.3 million
principal amount of our outstanding 6 5/8% senior notes due 2014 and $27.3 million principal amount
of our outstanding 7 1/8% senior notes due 2015. We recognized a net loss on
extinguishment of debt of $0 and $6.1 million for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, related to
these transactions. We also repaid
in full, at par, $49.8 million principal amount of our outstanding
8 3/4% senior notes due 2009 at maturity on May 1, 2009,
and we repaid $7.1 million and $82.6 million in mortgage debt
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009,
respectively. We funded these
repayments, purchases and tender offers with the net proceeds from
the sale of the 2016 Notes, our concurrent offering of common stock
and cash on hand. See “Note 11—Capital
Stock.”
Mortgages In June 2009,
we closed a pool of sixteen first-mortgage loans aggregating $114.2
million, secured by thirteen of our seniors housing communities
leased to Brookdale Senior Living and three of our seniors housing
communities leased to another tenant. In October 2009, we closed
the seventeenth and final first-mortgage loan in the pool in the
amount of $17.9 million, secured by an additional seniors housing
community leased to Brookdale Senior Living, bringing the total
aggregate principal amount of the seventeen-property loan pool to
$132.1 million. These loans mature in July 2019, and the total
weighted average fixed interest rate for the pool is 6.68% per
annum. In October
2009, we closed a first-mortgage loan in the original principal
amount of $40.5 million, secured by one of our seniors housing
communities leased to another tenant. The loan matures in
November 2014 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.14% per
annum.

Included in
""Liabilities of discontinued operations"" on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
The senior debt of CBS
Corp. is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned
subsidiary, CBS Operations Inc. Senior debt in the amount of
$52.2 million of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CBS
Broadcasting Inc., is not guaranteed.
On May 13, 2009,
CBS Corp. issued $350.0 million of 8.875% senior notes due
2019 and $400.0 million of 8.200% senior notes due 2014. On
June 2, 2009, CBS Corp. issued $250.0 million of 8.875%
senior notes due 2019. Interest on these senior notes will be paid
semi-annually. The senior notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by CBS Operations Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary
of CBS Corp.
During the nine months
ended September 30, 2009, the Company repurchased
$978.3 million of its 7.70% senior notes due 2010 resulting in
a loss on early extinguishment of debt of
$29.8 million.
At September 30,
2009, the Company classified $416.8 million of senior notes
maturing in July 2010 as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, reflecting its intent and ability to refinance this debt on
a long-term basis.
Credit
Facility
At September 30,
2009, the Company had a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility
which expires in December 2010 (the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit
Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated
Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, of 3x for the
trailing four quarters. At September 30, 2009, the Company's
Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 4x. The primary
purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper
borrowings. At September 30, 2009, the Company had no
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining
availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters
of credit, was $2.80 billion.
On November 4,
2009, the Company entered into a three-year $2.0 billion
revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2012. This
credit facility, which replaces the Company's previous credit
facility that was set to expire in December 2010, requires the
Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio and a
maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the credit
agreement.
Accounts
Receivable Securitization Program
The Company's
revolving accounts receivable securitization program provides for
the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis to unrelated third
parties on a one-year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts
receivable on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
Company entered into this arrangement because it provides an
additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from this program are used
to reduce outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving
securitization arrangement require that the receivable pools
subject to the program meet certain performance ratios. As of
September 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with the
required ratios under the receivable securitization program. During
the first quarter of 2009, the Company reduced amounts outstanding
under its accounts receivable securitization program by
$300.0 million and subsequently, during the third quarter of
2009, the Company increased the amounts outstanding by
$150.0 million, resulting in a net decrease of
$150.0 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2009. At September 30, 2009 the Company had
$400.0 million outstanding under its accounts receivable
securitization program versus $550.0 million at
December 31, 2008.
During the nine months
ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, proceeds from collections
of securitized accounts receivables of $1.05 billion and
$2.09 billion, respectively, were reinvested in the revolving
receivable securitization program. The net loss associated with
securitizing the program's accounts receivables was
$3.3 million and $4.6 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, and
$4.5 million and $12.2 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2008,
respectively.

The initial exchange rate
is 8.5051 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (or an
initial exchange price of approximately $117.58 per share of Boston
Properties, Inc.’s Common Stock). In addition, the Company
entered into capped call transactions with affiliates of certain of
the initial purchasers, which are intended to reduce the potential
dilution upon future exchange of the notes. The capped call
transactions are intended to increase the effective exchange price
to the Company of the notes from $117.58 to approximately $137.17
per share, representing an overall effective premium of
approximately 40% over the closing price on August 13, 2008 of
$97.98 per share of Boston Properties, Inc.’s Common Stock.
The net cost of the capped call transactions was approximately
$44.4 million. (3)
In connection with the
special distribution of $5.98 per share of Boston Properties,
Inc.’s Common Stock declared on December 17, 2007, the
exchange rate was adjusted from 6.6090 to 7.0430 shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007,
resulting in an exchange price of approximately $141.98 per share
of Boston Properties, Inc.’s Common Stock. (4)
In connection with the
special distribution of $5.98 per share of Boston Properties,
Inc.’s Common Stock declared on December 17, 2007, the
exchange rate was adjusted from 9.3900 to 10.0066 shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007,
resulting in an exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of
Boston Properties, Inc.’s Common Stock. ASC 470-20
(formerly known as FSP No. APB 14-1) requires the liability and
equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be
settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement)
to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the
issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. ASC 470-20
requires that the initial proceeds from the sale of the Operating
Partnership’s $862.5 million of 2.875% exchangeable senior
notes due 2037, $450.0 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes
due 2036 and $747.5 million of 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due
2014 be allocated between a liability component and an equity
component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the
interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt that could have been
issued by the Operating Partnership at such time. The Company
measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2.875%, 3.75%
and 3.625% exchangeable senior notes for the periods presented
based on effective interest rates of 5.630%, 5.958% and 6.555%,
respectively. The aggregate carrying amount of the debt component
was approximately $1.89 billion and $1.86 billion (net of the ASC
470-20 adjustment of approximately $150.3 million and $179.0
million) at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. As a result, the Company attributed an aggregate of
approximately $230.3 million of the proceeds to the equity
component of the notes, which represents the excess proceeds
received over the fair value of the notes at the date of issuance.
The equity component of the notes has been reflected within
Additional Paid-in Capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
Company reclassified approximately $1.0 million of deferred
financing costs to Additional Paid-in Capital, which represented
the costs attributable to the equity components of the notes. The
carrying amount of the equity component was approximately $229.3
million at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The
resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period during
which the debt is expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the
first optional redemption dates or, in the case of the 2014 notes,
the maturity date) as additional non-cash interest expense. The
additional non-cash interest expense attributable to each debt
security will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the
first optional redemption date (or, in the case of the 2014 notes,
the maturity date) as the debt accretes to its par value over the
same period. The aggregate contractual interest expense was
approximately $18.6 million and $15.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
approximately $55.8 million and $37.7 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result
of applying ASC 470-20, the Company reported additional non-cash
interest expense of approximately $9.8 million and $7.5 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, and approximately $28.7 million and $18.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. ASC 470-20 requires companies to retrospectively
apply the requirements of the pronouncement to all periods
presented. As a result, the revised diluted earnings per share
reflects a reduction of $0.05 and $0.12 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2008, respectively.

The difference between the stated and effective interest rates primarily reflects the effect of a treasury lock. See Note 10 for further information. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2009. These Notes will mature on May 1, 2019. On March 4, 2008, the Company issued $300 million of 6.35% Notes (with an effective interest rate of 6.68% per year).

Under the Program, the Company is authorized to sell from time to time short-term unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum of $500 million. The proceeds are used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. The Company uses the credit facility entered into in June 2007, as back-up liquidity to support the outstanding commercial paper. If at any time funds are not available on favorable terms under the Program, the Company may use its credit agreement for funding. In October 2008, the Company added an additional dealer to its Program. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had $100 million in commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.53% and remaining maturities ranging from five to 55 days."

Note 8. Debt On August 14, 2009, Cooper entered into a credit agreement that provides a $350 million three-year committed bank credit facility that replaces Cooper’s previous credit facility that was to mature in November 2009. The agreement for the credit facility requires that Cooper maintains certain financial ratios, including a prescribed limit on debt as a percentage of total capitalization and minimum earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest ratio. Retained earnings are unrestricted as to the payment of dividends, except to the extent that payment would cause a violation of the prescribed limit on the debt-to-total capitalization ratio. The credit agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in Cooper’s debt ratings or a material adverse change. At September 30, 2009, Cooper has $9.4 million of short-term debt and $277.3 million of current maturities of long-term debt. At September 30, 2009 Cooper had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. At September 30, 2009, Cooper has a U.S. committed credit facility for $350 million that matures in August 2012. On November 2, 2009, Cooper repaid the $275 million 5.5% senior unsecured notes at maturity. "

(2) Amount excludes premium of $11.4 million that was recorded upon acquisition. (3) Although we reduced our debt obligations by $2.0 million and $226.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, the gain is calculated based on the recorded debt balance, including related debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts. Credit Facilities In July 2009, we exercised our option to extend the maturity of our Global Line to October 6, 2010. In August 2009, we amended our Global Line, extending the maturity to August 21, 2012 and reducing the size of the aggregate commitments to $2.25 billion (subject to currency fluctuations), after October 6, 2010. The Global Line will continue to have a capacity of $3.8 billion (subject to currency fluctuations) through October 6, 2010. We may draw funds from a syndicate of banks in US dollars, euros, Japanese yen, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars, and until October 2010, South Korean won. Lenders who did not participate in the amended and extended facility will be subject to the pre-amendment pricing structure through October 6, 2010, while the new pricing structure is effective immediately to extending lenders. Based on our public debt ratings and a pricing grid, interest on the borrowings under the Global Line accrues at a variable rate based upon the interbank offered rate in each respective jurisdiction in which the borrowings are outstanding (2.27% per annum at September 30, 2009 based on a weighted average using local currency rates). We also have a 12.6 million British pound sterling facility, which matures December 31, 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, we reduced the commitment of this facility to the balance of the outstanding letters of credit. As of September 30, 2009, we had outstanding borrowings of $823.8 million and letters of credit of $124.1 million under these facilities, resulting in remaining borrowing capacity of approximately $2.9 billion. Convertible Notes We issued three series of convertible senior notes in 2007 and 2008 and refer to them in the aggregate as “Convertible Notes”. The Convertible Notes are senior obligations of ProLogis and are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash, our common shares or a combination of cash and our common shares, at our option, at a conversion rate per $1,000 of principal amount of the notes of 13.1614 shares for the March 2007 issuance, 12.2926 shares for the November 2007 issuance and 13.1203 shares for the May 2008 issuance. The initial conversion price ($76.58 for the March 2007 issuance, $82.00 for the November 2007 issuance and $76.22 for the May 2008 issuance) represented a premium of approximately 20% over the closing price of our common shares at the date of first sale and is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Convertible Notes, issued in 2007 and 2008, are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 and 2013, respectively, for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and at any time prior to maturity to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a REIT. Holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes for cash on specific dates approximately every five years beginning in 2012 and 2013 and at any time prior to their maturity upon certain limited circumstances. Therefore, we have reflected these amounts in 2012 and 2013 in the schedule of debt maturities below based on the first put date and we will amortize the discount through these dates. While we have the legal right to settle the conversion in either cash or shares, we intend to settle the principal balance of the Convertible Notes in cash and, therefore, we have not included the effect of the conversion of these notes in our computation of diluted earnings per share. Based on the current conversion rates, 30.6 million shares would be required to settle the principal amount in shares. Such potentially dilutive shares, and the corresponding adjustment to interest expense, are not included in our computation of diluted earnings per share. The amount in excess of the principal balance of the notes (the “Conversion Spread”) will be settled in cash or, at our option, ProLogis common shares. If the Conversion Spread becomes dilutive to our earnings per share, (i.e., if our share price exceeds $75.98 for the March 2007 issuance, $81.35 for the November 2007 issuance or $76.22 for the May 2008 issuance) we will include the shares in our computation of diluted earnings per share.

The proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our credit facilities and other debt. font> During the third quarter of 2009, we repaid maturing debt of $250.0 million with borrowings under our Global Line. On October 1, 2009, we completed a consent solicitation with regard to our senior notes, other than our Convertible Notes, to amend certain covenants and events of default contained in the indenture governing the note
s and to provide that all series of the senior notes issued under the indenture, other than the Convertible Notes, will have the same financial covenants and events of default. Due to the terms of the Convertible Notes, they are not subject to financial covenants. Secured Mortgage Debt During the second quarter of 2009, we issued $391.7 million in secured mortgage debt including $101.8 million at 6.5% due July 2014, $245.5 million at 7.55% due July 2019 and a ¥4.3 billion TMK bond ($47.4 million at September 30, 2009) at 4.09% (effective fixed rate including interest rate swap contract) that matures in June 2012. TMK bonds are a financing vehicle in Japan for special purpose companies known as TMKs. These financings are secured by 65 real estate properties with an aggregate undepreciated cost of $1.2 billion at September 30, 2009. &l

7,198.5 Revolving Credit Facilities Our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility due April 2012 and our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility due September 2013 (collectively, the Credit Facilities) bear interest at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate for the Credit Facility due September 2013, both terms defined in the agreements, plus an applicable margin based on our Debt Ratings, also a term defined in the agreements. As of December 31, 2008, the interest rate for our borrowings under our Credit Facilities was 3.43%. The Credit Facilities are also subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments, regardless of usage. At September 30, 2009, we had no Eurodollar Rate borrowings or Base Rate borrowings and $1,630.7 million of revolver capacity used to support outstanding letters of credit, leaving $1,119.3 million of available liquidity under the Credit Facilities. The agreements governing the Credit Facilities require us to maintain certain financial and other covenants. We have the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in compliance with these covenants. At September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facilities. Receivables Secured Loans We have an accounts receivable securitization program with two financial institutions that allows us to borrow up to $300.0 million on a revolving basis under loan agreements secured by receivables. In May 2009, we renewed the facility for 364 days and reduced the borrowing capacity from $400.0 million to $300.0 million. If we are unable to renew the facility when it matures in May 2010, we will refinance any amounts outstanding with our Credit Facilities or with other long-term borrowings. Despite our ability to refinance or renew the facility, the loan is classified as current because it has a contractual maturity of less than one year. The receivables securitizing this facility are held in and owned by a wholly owned and fully consolidated subsidiary. This subsidiary is a separate corporate entity whose assets, or collateral securing the borrowings, are available first to satisfy the claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. At September 30, 2009, the total amount of accounts receivable (gross) serving as collateral securing the facility was $469.2 million. This facility is accounted for as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral. The receivables and debt obligation remain on our consolidated balance sheet. The borrowings under this facility bear interest at the financial institutions’ commercial paper rate plus an applicable spread and interest is payable monthly. Senior Notes and Debentures In September 2009, we issued $650.0 million of 5.500% senior notes due 2019 in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from this offering, less discounts and certain fees, were approximately $641 million. The notes are general senior unsecured obligations and mature on September 15, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, beginning March 15, 2010. The notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantee our Credit Facilities. These guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors. In addition, in September 2009, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the representatives of the initial purchasers of the notes. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement to exchange the notes for freely tradable notes issued by us. If we are unable to effect the exchange offer within 365 days, we agreed to pay additional interest on the notes. Proceeds from the notes were used to purchase and retire $325.5 million of our outstanding senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011. During the three months ended September 30, 2009, we incurred a $31.8 million charge associated with the early extinguishment of these notes.

1,137.5 As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, our senior notes and debentures totaled $5,257.9 million and $4,985.9 million, net of unamortized discounts and premiums of $31.5 million and $27.5 million, remaining unamortized adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for the acquisition of Allied of $468.7 million and $536.2 million, and adjustments to fair value related to our interest rate swap agreements of $11.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively. Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures Our $230.0 million of 4.25% unsecured senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2034 are convertible into 5.2 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $43.86 per share. These debentures are convertible at the option of the holder anytime if certain conditions occur, as outlined in the agreement. We can elect to settle the conversion in stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash. We can elect to call the debentures at any time after April 15, 2009 at par for cash only. The holders can require us to redeem some or all of the debentures on April 15th of 2011, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029 at par for stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash at our option. If the debentures are redeemed in stock, the number of shares issued will be determined at the par value of the debentures divided by the average trading stock price of the preceding five-day period. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the unamortized adjustment to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for these debentures was $19.3 million and $28.7 million, respectively, which is being amortized to interest expense through April 15, 2011, the first date that the holders can require us to redeem the debentures. Tax-Exempt Financings As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had $1,228.7 million and $1,308.2 million, respectively, of fixed and variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2037. Approximately two-thirds of our tax-exempt financings are remarketed weekly or daily, by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. These variable rate tax-exempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with credit ratings of A or better. The holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period. As of September 30, 2009, we had $254.9 million of restricted cash and marketable securities, of which $113.4 million were proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings, and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. Restricted cash also includes amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the unamortized adjustment to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for these tax-exempt financings was $50.0 million and $52.9 million, respectively, which is being amortized to interest expense. Other Debt Other debt primarily includes capital lease liabilities of $141.7 million and $139.5 million as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, with maturities ranging from 2009 to 2042. Fair Value of Debt The fair value of our fixed rate senior notes using quoted market rates is $6.0 billion and $5.2 billion at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The carrying value of our fixed rate senior notes is $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The carrying amounts of our remaining notes payable and tax-exempt financings approximate fair value because interest rates are variable and, accordingly, approximate current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change. For active hedge arrangements, the fair value of the derivatives is included in the consolidated balance sheets. Guarantees Substantially all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the Credit Facilities. We and substantially all of our subsidiaries (including substantially all of the subsidiaries of Allied) guarantee series of senior notes issued by Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA), a subsidiary of Allied (the AWNA Senior Notes). The guarantees of the AWNA Senior Notes by our subsidiaries (other than the guarantee by Allied) would be automatically released upon the release of such subsidiaries from their guarantee obligations under the Credit Facilities. We and substantially all our subsidiaries (including substantially all of the subsidiaries of Allied) also guarantee the 9.250% debentures due 2021 and the 7.400% debentures due 2035 issued by Browning-Ferris Industries, LLC (successor to Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.) (BFI), another subsidiary of Allied (the BFI Debentures). The guarantees of the BFI Debentures by our subsidiaries (other than the guarantees by Allied and AWNA) would be automatically released upon the release of such subsidiaries from their guarantee obligations under the Credit Facilities. Substantially all of our subsidiaries (including Allied and substantially all of its subsidiaries) have guaranteed our 6.750% senior notes due 2011, our 5.500% senior notes due 2019 and our 6.086% senior notes due 2035 (the Republic Senior Notes). The guarantees of the Republic Senior Notes by our subsidiaries would be automatically released upon the release of such subsidiaries from their guarantee obligations under the Credit Facilities. We have guaranteed some of the tax-exempt bonds of our subsidiaries. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations associated with tax-exempt bonds as they come due, we will be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No additional liability has been recorded for these guarantees because the underlying obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest Paid Interest paid was $346.0 million and $72.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The components of interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Interest expense $

65.1 Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have managed risk associated with executing this strategy, particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. We also entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The swap agreements have a total notional value of $210.0 million and mature in August 2011. This maturity is identical to our senior notes that also mature in 2011. Under the swap agreements, we pay interest at floating rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6.75%. We have designated these agreements as hedges in changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. We have determined that these agreements qualify for the short-cut method, and, therefore, changes in the fair value of the agreements are assumed to be perfectly effective in hedging changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, interest rate swap agreements are reflected at their fair value of $11.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively, and are included in other assets and as an adjustment to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes the impact of changes in the fair value of our derivatives and the underlying hedged items on our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): Gain (Loss) on Swap Gain (Loss) on Fixed-Rate Debt Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Interest Expense $

In September 2009, we entered into treasury lock agreements having an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million to hedge interest rates on the 10 year U.S. Treasury Notes in connection with the issuance of our $650.0 million 5.500% senior notes. Upon issuance of the notes we terminated the treasury locks and paid approximately $2.5 million to the counterparties. The $1.4 million, net of tax was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as an increase to interest expense over the life of the issued debt. This transaction was accounted for as a cash flow hedge. As of September 30, 2009, no treasury lock cash flow hedges were outstanding. "

Note 7 –
Borrowings On
March 10, 2009, the Company issued $1.0 billion of 6.60%
unsecured senior notes due March 15, 2019 (the “March
2009 Notes”). The March 2009 Notes pay interest semi-annually
and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a defined redemption
price plus accrued interest. The net proceeds were used to repay
the bridge credit facility, a portion of the Company’s
outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate
purposes. On July 1,
2009, the Company issued a $300 million unsecured floating rate
senior note due January 30, 2011 (the “the 2009 Floating
Rate Note”). The 2009 Floating Rate Note pays interest
quarterly. The net proceeds from the 2009 Floating Rate Note will
be used for general corporate purposes. On
September 8, 2009, the Company issued $1.5 billion of 6.125%
unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2039 (the
“September 2009 Notes”). The September 2009 Notes pay
interest semi-annually and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at
a defined redemption price plus accrued interest. The net proceeds
were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding
commercial paper borrowings, $650 million of unsecured senior notes
and for general corporate purposes. As of
September 30, 2009, the Company’s financial instruments
included cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Due
to the short-term nature of these instruments, the Company’s
carrying amount approximates fair value. The carrying amount and
estimated fair value of long-term debt was $8.3 billion and $8.6
billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2009. The carrying
amount and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $7.9 billion
and $6.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. The
fair value of long-term debt was estimated based on rates then
currently offered to the Company for debt with similar terms and
maturities.

lt;font class=""_mt"">5.625% Senior Notes Due January 15, 2014 and 6.30% Senior Notes Due January 15, 2019 In January 2009, Devon issued $500 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2014 and $700 million of 6.30% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2019. The net proceeds received of $1
.187 billion, after discounts and issuance costs, were used primarily to repay Devon's $1.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2008. Credit Lines Devon has two syndicated, unsecured revolving lines of credit that can be accessed to provide liquidity as needed. The following schedule summarizes the capacity of Devon's credit facilities by maturity date, as well as its available capacity as of September 30, 2009.

sed $700 million short-term facility matured. On November 3, 2009, Devon established a new $700 million 364-day, syndicated, unsecured revolving senior credit facility (the “Short-Term Facility”). The Short-Term Facility matures on November 2, 2010. On the maturity date, all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time. Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term Facility bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to 12 months. Such rates are generally based on LIBOR or the prime rate. The Short-Term Facility provides for an annual facility fee of approximately $1.75 million that is payable quarterly in arrears. The credit facilities contain only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon’s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65%. The credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Also, total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of September 30, 2009, Devon was in compliance with this covenant. Devon’s debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2009, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 21.3%. Commercial Paper Subsequent to the $1.0 billion commercial paper repayment in January 2009, Devon utilized additional net commercial paper borrowings of $1.4 billion to fund capital expenditure payments in excess of cash generated by operating activities during the first nine months of 2009. As of September 30, 2009, Devon’s average borrowing rate on its $1.4 billion of commercial paper debt was 0.32%. div>"

Indebtedness In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the Company, from time to time, to purchase its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, depend upon prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements and other factors; such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice. During 2009, the Company repurchased an aggregate $35,600,000 principal amount of its 7% Senior Notes due 2013 and recognized pre-tax gains of $6,000,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, which are reflected in investment and other income. During 2009, the Company issued 5,238,622 common shares upon the conversion of $120,314,000 principal amount of the Company’s 33/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, pursuant to privately negotiated transactions to induce conversion. The number of common shares issued was in accordance with the terms of the notes; however, the Company paid the former noteholders $25,300,000 in addition to the shares. The additional cash payments were recorded as selling, general and other expenses. Debt due within one year includes $196,200,000 and $151,100,000 as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, relating to repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2009, these fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 0.4%, mature in November 2009 and are collateralized by non-current investments with a carrying value of $209,500,000. In April 2009, the Company’s real estate subsidiary, MB1, received several notices of default with respect to $100,400,000 of nonrecourse indebtedness that is collateralized by its real estate project. Although MB1’s bank loan matured in October 2009, it was not repaid since MB1 did not have sufficient funds and the Company is under no obligation and has no intention to provide the funds to pay off the loan. MB1 received an additional default notice for failure to repay the bank loan but its lenders have not commenced foreclosure proceedings. The loan has been classified as a current liability as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. In June 2009, the Company terminated its $100,000,000 bank credit facility; no amounts were outstanding under this facility. "

4. Borrowings The Company had $1.2 billion of fixed and floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (“Junior Subordinated Debentures”) outstanding at September 30, 2009 which are held by various trusts that were issued in connection with the issuance by those trusts of preferred capital securities (“Capital Securities”) and common securities (“Common Securities”). The proceeds from the issuances of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities were used by the trusts to purchase the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The Common Securities of each of those trusts are wholly owned by M&T and are the only class of each trust’s securities possessing general voting powers. The Capital Securities represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the corresponding trust. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s current risk-based capital guidelines, the Capital Securities are includable in M&T’s Tier 1 capital. As a result of the acquisition of Provident, M&T assumed $133 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures that mature at various dates from 2028 to 2033. Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential cumulative cash distributions unless M&T exercises its right to extend the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures as allowed by the terms of each such debenture, in which case payment of distributions on the respective Capital Securities will be deferred for comparable periods. During an extended interest period, M&T may not pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or acquire any shares of its capital stock. In the event of an extended interest period exceeding twenty quarterly periods for $350 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures due January 31, 2068, M&T must fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest through an alternative payment mechanism, which requires M&T to issue common stock, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock until M&T has raised an amount of eligible proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures due January 31, 2068. In general, the agreements governing the Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by M&T of the payment of distributions on, the redemption of, and any liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital Securities. The obligations under such guarantee and the Capital Securities are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of M&T. The Capital Securities will remain outstanding until the Junior Subordinated Debentures are repaid at maturity, are redeemed prior to maturity or are distributed in liquidation to the Trusts. The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole, but not in part, upon repayment at the stated maturity dates (ranging from 2027 to 2068) of the Junior Subordinated Debentures or the earlier redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole upon the occurrence of one or more events set forth in the indentures relating to the Capital Securities, and in whole or in part at any time after an optional redemption prior to contractual maturity contemporaneously with the optional redemption of the related Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole or in part, subject to possible regulatory approval. In connection with the issuance of 8.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities associated with $350 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures maturing in 2068, M&T entered into a replacement capital covenant that provides that neither M&T nor any of its subsidiaries will repay, redeem or purchase any of the Junior Subordinated Debentures due January 31, 2068 or the 8.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities prior to January 31, 2048, with certain limited exceptions, except to the extent that, during the 180 days prior to the date of that repayment, redemption or purchase, M&T and its subsidiaries have received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that (i) have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the 8.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities or the Junior Subordinated Debentures due January 31, 2068, as applicable, at the time of repayment, redemption or purchase, and (ii) M&T has obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if required. On June 30, 2009, M&T retired $12 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures for which Provident had been the owner of the related Capital Securities. Including the unamortized portions of purchase accounting adjustments to reflect estimated fair value at the acquisition dates of the Common Securities of various trusts and reflecting the noted cancellation of Junior Subordinated Debentures on June 30, 2009, the Junior Subordinated Debentures associated with Capital Securities had financial statement carrying values of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

manage liquidity, including the funding of the maturing notes.
There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at
September 30, 2009.
On October 23, 2009, MMC and
certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.0 billion
multi-currency three-year unsecured revolving credit facility,
which replaced the $1.2 billion facility discussed below, which was
in effect as of September 30, 2009. The interest rate on this
facility varies based upon MMC’s credit ratings and
MMC’s credit default swap levels subject to floors and caps.
The facility requires MMC to maintain certain coverage and leverage
ratios which are tested quarterly.
MMC and certain of its foreign
subsidiaries previously maintained a $1.2 billion multi-currency
revolving credit facility. The facility was due to expire in
December 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under this
facility at September 30, 2009. "

premium that can range from 16.0 to 40.0 basis points of the
outstanding borrowing amount depending on the Debt/EBITDA ratio.
The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of
borrowing activity under the 2007 Facility. The quarterly fees for
the 2007 Facility can range from 4.0 to 10.0 basis points per
annum of the facility amount, depending on the Company’s
Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays a utilization fee of
5.0 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate
amount outstanding exceeds 50% of the total facility. The weighted
average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as
December 31, 2008 was 1.47%. The 2007 Facility contains
certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of
the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval
of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales,
transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to
incur liens, as defined in the related agreement. The 2007 Facility
also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require
the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to
1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.
Commercial
Paper On
October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a private placement
commercial paper program under which the Company may issue CP notes
up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Amounts available under the
CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is supported by the
Company’s 2007 Facility. The maturities of the CP Notes will
vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP
Notes are sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, sold at
par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market
conditions at the time of issuance. The rates of interest will
depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate.
The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following:
(a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper
rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the LIBOR;
(e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other
base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private
placement agreement. The weighted average interest rate on CP
borrowings outstanding was 0.3% and 2.08% as of September 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The CP Program
contains certain events of default including, among other things:
non-payment of principal, interest or fees; violation of covenants;
invalidity of any loan document; material judgments; and bankruptcy
and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure
periods.
Notes
Payable On
September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a
private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal
amount of its 6.06% Series 2007-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due
2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007-1 Notes
have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.06%,
payable semi-annually on March 7 and September 7. Under
the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time
within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series
of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0
million pursuant to one or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement.
The Company may prepay the Series 2007-1 Notes, in whole or in
part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make Whole
Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the
ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among
other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of
assets, incur or create liens, enter into any sale-leaseback
transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey,
transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must
also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at
the end of any fiscal quarter. On
September 30, 2005, the Company issued and sold through a
private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal
amount of its Series 2005-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015
pursuant to the 2005 Agreement. The Series 2005-1 Notes have a
ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable
semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. Proceeds from
the sale of the Series 2005-1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0
million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s
outstanding 7.61% senior notes which matured on September 30,
2005. In the event that Moody’s pays all, or part, of the
Series 2005-1 Notes in advance of their maturity, such prepayment
will be subject to a Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005-1 Notes are
subject to certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the
ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the
approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations,
asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback
transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related
agreements.
2008 Term
Loan On May 7,
2008, Moody’s entered into a five-year, $150.0 million senior
unsecured term loan with several lenders. Proceeds from the loan
were used to pay off a portion of the CP outstanding. Interest on
borrowings under the 2008 Term Loan is payable quarterly at rates
that are based on LIBOR plus a margin that can range from 125 basis
points to 175 basis points depending on the Company’s
Debt/EBITDA ratio. The outstanding borrowings shall amortize
beginning in 2010 in accordance with the schedule of payments set
forth in the 2008 Term Loan outlined in the table below. The 2008 Term
Loan contains restrictive covenants that, among other things,
restrict the ability of the Company to engage or to permit its
subsidiaries to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales,
transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to
incur, or permit its subsidiaries to incur, liens, in each case,
subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 2008 Term Loan
also limits the amount of debt that subsidiaries of the Company may
incur. In addition, the 2008 Term Loan contains a financial
covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio
of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal
quarter.
The principal payments due
on the 2008 Term Loan through its maturity are as
follows: Year Ending

150.0 At
September 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all
covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition
to the covenants described above, the 2007 Facility, the 2005
Agreement, the 2007 Agreement and the 2008 Term Loan contain cross
default provisions. These provisions state that default under one
of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders
under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding
under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. As of
September 30, 2009, there were no such cross
defaults.

offer to exchange shares of its common stock for any and all of the
5,498,544 outstanding units of its Bifurcated Option Note Unit
SecuritiESSM
(the
“BONUSES units”). The BONUSES units were issued on
November 4, 2002 by the Company and are listed on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol “NYB.PrU.” Each unit
consists of a trust preferred security issued by New York Community
Capital Trust V and a warrant to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock. All holders of
BONUSES units were eligible to participate in the exchange offer,
the terms and conditions of which were set forth in an Offer to
Exchange and a related Letter of Transmittal that were sent to
current holders of the BONUSES units and filed with the SEC on a
Schedule TO, as amended. A total of
1,393,063 BONUSES units were validly tendered, not withdrawn, and
accepted in the exchange offer, representing 25.3% of the 5,498,544
BONUSES units outstanding at the expiration date. As a result,
trust preferred securities totaling $48.6 million were extinguished
in August 2009. The Company
issued 4.8 million shares of its common stock as a result of
the exchange, which added $39.1 million to stockholders’
equity at September 30, 2009. In addition, a $5.7 million gain
on debt exchange was recorded in non-interest income in the third
quarter of 2009.

DEBT Non-Bank Debt Under the indenture related to our $100 million of 6.75% senior notes with a maturity date of October 15, 2037, on July 31, 2009, we notified the holders of such notes of our obligation to purchase any of those notes for which a written notice of purchase (purchase notice) was received from the holders prior to September 15, 2009. A purchase notice was received related to $76 million of the outstanding notes, which resulted in a charge of $6 million in the third quarter of 2009 to write off a pro rata portion of unamortized fair value adjustment. We redeemed the $76 million of notes at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to October 15, 2009, the date of the payment of the purchase price. On April 1, 2009, we made scheduled debt repayments of $200 million related to our 3.5% notes and $9 million related to our 5.125% Series 1997D industrial revenue bonds. In March 2009, we issued $750 million of 9.375% notes due March 15, 2019 and $250 million of 10.5% notes due March 15, 2039. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled $998 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other issuance costs of $8 million. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed our 9.50% senior notes for $367 million, or 104.75% of stated value. These notes had a carrying amount of $381 million on the date of redemption, resulting in a gain of $14 million that was included in “other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statement of income. In addition, in March 2008, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $7 million related to certain of our other debt. Bank Credit Facilities In October 2009, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, one of the participating banks under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, failed to fund its loan commitment related to our borrowing under this facility discussed below. Lehman Brothers’ aggregate commitment under the revolving credit facility was $84 million. As a result, our borrowing capacity under that revolving credit facility has been reduced to $2.4 billion commencing in October 2009. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we had no borrowings or repayments under our revolving bank credit facilities. As of September 30, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving bank credit facilities. In October 2009, we borrowed and subsequently repaid approximately $40 million under our U.S. committed revolving bank credit facility. As of September 30, 2009, we had $76 million of letters of credit outstanding under our uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities and $113 million of letters of credit outstanding under our U.S. committed revolving credit facilities. Under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility, we had Cdn. $19 million of letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2009. In June 2008, we entered into a one-year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we could obtain letters of credit of up to $300 million to support certain of our crude oil purchases. In June 2009, we amended this agreement to extend the maturity date to June 2010. We are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with the letter of credit facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we borrowed and repaid $296 million under our U.S. committed revolving bank credit facility. In July 2008, we entered into a one-year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we could obtain letters of credit of up to $275 million. This credit facility expired in July 2009. Accounts Receivable Sales Facility We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables. We amended our agreement in June 2009 to extend the maturity date to June 2010. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial institutions was $100 million, which was repaid in February 2009. In March 2009, we sold $100 million of eligible receivables to the third-party entities and financial institutions. In April 2009, we sold an additional $400 million of eligible receivables under this program, which we repaid in June 2009. As of September 30, 2009, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial institutions was $100 million. Proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance sheets. Other Disclosures The estimated fair value of our debt, including current portion, was as follows (in millions): September 30, December 31, 2009 2008 Carrying amount $ 7,338 $ 6,537 Fair value 8,335 6,462 "

unsecured debt currently consists of $11.6 billion of senior
unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership and our
$3.5 billion unsecured credit facility, or Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 37.5 basis points
and an additional facility fee of 12.5 basis points. The Credit
Facility matures January 11, 2010 and may be extended one year
at our option. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the Operating
Partnership repaid five series of unsecured notes totaling
$900.0 million, which had fixed rates ranging from 3.50% to
8.63%. On
March 25, 2009, the Operating Partnership issued
$650.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest
rate of 10.35% due April 1, 2019. We used the proceeds from
the offering to reduce borrowings on the Credit Facility and for
general working capital purposes. On
May 15, 2009, the Operating Partnership issued
$600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest
rate of 6.75% due May 15, 2014. On August 11, 2009, we
issued an additional $500.0 million of the same series of
senior unsecured notes in a re-opening of the initial offering. We
used the proceeds from the offerings for general working capital
purposes. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we drew amounts from
the Credit Facility to fund the repayment of $600.0 million of
maturing unsecured notes. We repaid a total of $1.2 billion on
the Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30,
2009. The total outstanding balance of the Credit Facility as of
September 30, 2009 was $456.2 million, all related to the
U.S. dollar equivalent of Euro and Yen-denominated borrowings, and
the maximum amount outstanding during the nine months ended
September 30, 2009 was approximately $1.6 billion. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the weighted average
outstanding balance was approximately
$739.8 million. Secured Debt Total
secured indebtedness was $6.6 billion and $6.3 billion at
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. On
July 30, 2009, we borrowed $400.0 million on a loan which
matures on August 1, 2016 and bears interest at a fixed rate
of 8.00%. This loan is secured by cross-collateralized,
cross-defaulted mortgages on Greenwood Park Mall, South Park Mall,
and Walt Whitman Mall. Fair Value of
Debt The
carrying value of our variable-rate mortgages and other loans
approximates their fair values. We estimate the fair values of
consolidated fixed-rate mortgages using cash flows discounted at
current borrowing rates and other indebtedness using cash flows at
current market rates. We estimate the fair values of consolidated
fixed-rate unsecured notes using quoted market prices, or, if no
quoted market prices are available, we use quoted market prices for
securities with similar terms and maturities. The fair values of
our fixed-rate debt at September 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008 was $16.5 billion and
$12.4 billion, respectively, compared to carrying values at
those dates of $16.2 billion and $14.9 billion,
respectively.

The Company has never drawn on these facilities. These facilities include a $1.9 billion revolving credit facility maturing in October 2010 and a $1.6 billion revolving credit facility maturing in October 2011. These figures do not include a $215 million commitment from Aurora Bank, FSB, formerly known as Lehman Brothers Bank, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, which declared bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. The Company is operating under the assumption that the lending commitment of Aurora Bank, FSB, will not be honored if drawn upon. While the Company continues to explore various options, it does not anticipate replacing its commitment from Aurora Bank, FSB. On April 24, 2009, in conjunction with the extension of the 2008 ABCP Facilities, a $1.4 billion revolving credit facility maturing in October 2009 was retired and a $1.9 billion revolving credit facility maturing in October 2011 was reduced to $1.6 billion. In connection with the early termination of the unsecured revolving credit facilities, interest on these facilities, if drawn, increases to LIBOR plus 450 basis points. The principal financial covenants in the unsecured revolving credit facilities require the Company to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of at least $1.38 billion at all times. Consolidated tangible net worth as calculated for purposes of this covenant was $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2009. The covenants also require the Company to meet either a minimum interest coverage ratio or a minimum net adjusted revenue test based on the four preceding quarters’ adjusted “Core Earnings” financial performance. The Company was compliant with both the minimum interest coverage ratio and the minimum net adjusted revenue tests as of the quarter ended September 30, 2009. Failure to meet these covenants would result in the facilities being withdrawn. In the past, the Company has not relied upon its unsecured revolving credit facilities as a primary source of liquidity. Although the Company has never borrowed under these facilities, they are available to be drawn upon for general corporate purposes. Secured Borrowings Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries. A VIE exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself, or the equity investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest. Those characteristics are the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity’s activities that have a significant impact on the success of the entity, the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity, and the rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. The Company currently consolidates a number of financing entities that are VIEs as a result of being the entities’ primary beneficiary. As a result, these financing VIEs are accounted for as secured borrowings. The process of identifying the primary beneficiary involves identifying all other parties that hold variable interests in the entity and determining which of the parties, including the Company, has the responsibility to absorb the majority of the entity’s expected losses or the rights to its expected residual returns. The Company is the primary beneficiary of and currently consolidates the following financing VIEs as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008: September 30, 2009 Debt Outstanding Short Long Carrying Amount of Assets Securing Debt Outstanding (Dollars in millions) Term Term Total Loans Cash Other Assets Total Secured Borrowings: ED Participation Program facility $ 22,864 $ — $ 22,864 $ 23,226 $ 206 $ 371 $ 23,803 ED Conduit Program facility 14,190 — 14,190 14,396 438 423 15,257 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities(1) 9,434 — 9,434 10,819 233 90 11,142 On-balance sheet securitizations — 88,961 88,961 92,274 3,588 3,425 99,287 Indentured trusts 66 1,629 1,695 2,177 193 26 2,396 46,554 90,590 137,144 142,892 4,658 4,335 151,885 ASC 815 fair value adjustment — 1,632 1,632 — — — — Total $ 46,554 $ 92,222 $ 138,776 $ 142,892 $ 4,658 $ 4,335 $ 151,885 (1) Includes $253 million of assets within the facility that can be released to the Company.

The initial term of the 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities was 364 days. The underlying cost of borrowing under the 2008 ABCP Facilities was approximately LIBOR plus 0.68 percent for the FFELP loan facilities and LIBOR plus 1.55 percent for the Private Education Loan facility, excluding upfront and unused commitment fees. All-in pricing on the 2008 ABCP Facilities varies based on usage. For the full year 2008, the combined, all-in cost of borrowings related to the 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities, including amortized upfront fees and unused commitment fees, was three-month LIBOR plus 2.47 percent. The primary use of the 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities was to refinance comparable ABCP facilities incurred in connection with the Proposed Merger, with the expectation that outstanding balances under the 2008 Asset-Backed Financing Facilities would be reduced through securitization of the underlying student loan collateral in the term ABS market. On February 2, 2009, the Company extended the maturity date of the 2008 ABCP Facilities from February 28, 2009 to April 28, 2009 for a $61 million upfront fee. The other terms of the facilities remained materially unchanged. On February 27, 2009, the Company extended the maturity date of the 2008 Asset-Backed Loan Facility from February 28, 2009 to April 28, 2009 for a $4 million upfront fee. The other terms of this facility remained materially unchanged. On April 24, 2009, the Company extended the maturity of $21.8 billion of the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility for one year to April 23, 2010. The Company also extended its 2008 Asset-Backed Loan Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion. The extended 2008 Asset-Backed Loan Facility matured on June 26, 2009 and was paid in full. A total of $86 million in fees were paid related to these extensions. The 2008 Private Education Loan ABCP Facility was paid off and terminated on April 24, 2009. The stated borrowing rate of the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility is the applicable funding rate plus 130 basis points excluding upfront fees. The applicable funding rate generally will be either a LIBOR or commercial paper rate. The terms of the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility call for an increase in the applicable funding spread to 300 basis points if the outstanding borrowing amount was not reduced to $15.2 billion and $10.9 billion as of June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The outstanding borrowings were reduced to $12.5 billion and $9.4 billion on June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, respectively. If the Company does not negotiate an extension or pay off all outstanding amounts of the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility at maturity, the facility will extend by 90 days with the interest rate generally increasing from LIBOR plus 250 basis points to 550 basis points over the 90 day period. The other terms of the facilities remained materially unchanged. The maximum amount the Company may borrow under the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility is limited based on certain factors, including market conditions and the fair value of student loans in the facility. As of September 30, 2009, the maximum borrowing amount was approximately $10.5 billion. Funding under the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility is subject to usual and customary conditions. The 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility is subject to termination under certain circumstances, including the Company’s failure to comply with the principal financial covenants in its unsecured revolving credit facilities. Borrowings under the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility are nonrecourse to the Company. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had $9.4 billion outstanding in connection with the 2008 FFELP ABCP Facility. The book basis of the assets securing this facility as of September 30, 2009 was $10.9 billion. The Department of Education (“ED”) Funding Programs In August 2008, ED implemented the Loan Purchase Commitment Program (“Purchase Program”) and the Loan Purchase Participation Program (“Participation Program”) pursuant to ECASLA. Under the Purchase Program, ED purchases eligible FFELP loans at a price equal to the sum of (i) par value, (ii) accrued interest, (iii) the one-percent origination fee paid to ED, and (iv) a fixed amount of $75 per loan. Under the Participation Program, ED provides short-term liquidity to FFELP lenders by purchasing participation interests in pools of FFELP loans. FFELP lenders are charged a rate of the preceding quarter commercial paper rate plus 0.50 percent on the principal amount of participation interests outstanding. Under the terms of the Participation Program, on September 30, 2010, AY 2009-2010 loans funded under the Participation Program must be either repurchased by the Company or sold to ED pursuant to the Participation Program, which has identical economics to the Purchase Program. Loans eligible for the Participation or Purchase Programs were originally limited to FFELP Stafford or PLUS, first disbursed on or after May 1, 2008 but no later than July 1, 2009, with no ongoing borrower benefits other than permitted rate reductions of 0.25 percent for automatic payment processing. On October 7, 2008, legislation was enacted extending ED’s authority to finance and purchase FFELP Stafford and PLUS loans made for AY’s 2009-2010, and allowing for the extension of ED’s Purchase and Participation Programs from September 30, 2009 to September 30, 2010. On November 8, 2008, ED formally announced new purchase and participation programs which cover eligible loans originated for the AY 2009-2010. On January 15, 2009, ED announced that the terms of the programs for AY 2009-2010 will replicate in all material respects the terms of the programs for AY 2008-2009. The Company applied for these AY 2009-2010 funding programs in June 2009 and its participation was approved on July 31, 2009. On August 14, 2008, the Company received its initial advance under the Participation Program. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had $22.9 billion of advances outstanding under the Participation Program. Through October 15, 2009, the Company has sold to ED approximately $18.5 billion face amount of loans as part of the Purchase Program (approximately $840 million face amount was sold in the third quarter of 2009). Outstanding debt of $18.5 billion has been paid down related to the Participation Program in connection with these loan sales. Also pursuant to ECASLA, on January 15, 2009, ED published summary terms under which it will purchase eligible FFELP Stafford and PLUS loans from a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for eligible student lenders (the “ED Conduit Program”). Loans eligible for the ED Conduit Program must be first disbursed on or after October 1, 2003, but not later than July 1, 2009, and fully disbursed before September 30, 2009, and meet certain other requirements including with respect to borrower benefits. The ED Conduit Program was launched on May 11, 2009 and will accept eligible loans through July 1, 2010. The ED Conduit Program has a term of five years and will expire on January 19, 2014. Funding for the ED Conduit Program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates, with the Company being advanced 97 percent of the student loan face amount. The Student Loan Short-Term Notes (“SLST Notes”), issued by the ED Conduit, are supported by a combination of i) Funding Notes backed by FFELP student loans, ii) the Liquidity Agreement with the Federal Financing Bank (“FFB”), and iii) the Put Agreement provided by ED. If the conduit does not have sufficient funds to pay all SLST Notes, then those SLST Notes will be repaid with funds from the FFB. The FFB will hold the notes for a short period of time and, if at the end of that time, the SLST Notes still cannot be paid off, the underlying FFELP loans that serve as collateral to the ED Conduit will be sold to ED through the Put Agreement at a price of 97 percent of the face amount of the loans. As of September 30, 2009, approximately $14.1 billion face amount of the Company’s Stafford and PLUS loans were funded through the ED Conduit Program with a weighted average issuance cost of approximately 0.87 percent. As of September 30, 2009, there are approximately $1.1 billion face amount of additional FFELP Stafford and PLUS loans (excluding loans currently in the Participation Program) that can be funded through the ED Conduit Program. Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (“TALF”) On February 6, 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published proposed terms for a program designed to facilitate renewed issuance of consumer and small business ABS at lower interest rate spreads. TALF was initiated on March 17, 2009 and currently provides investors who purchase eligible ABS with funding of up to five years. Eligible ABS include ‘AAA’ rated student loan ABS backed by FFELP and private student loans first disbursed since May 1, 2007. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had approximately $10.6 billion book basis of student loans (including $7.3 billion book basis of Private Education Loans and $3.3 billion book basis of Consolidation Loans) eligible to serve as collateral for ABS funded under TALF; this amount does not include loans eligible for ECASLA financing programs. For student loan collateral, TALF is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2010. On May 5, 2009, the Company priced a $2.6 billion Private Education Loan securitization which closed on May 12, 2009. The issue bears a coupon of 1-month LIBOR plus 6.0 percent and is callable at the issuer’s option at 93 percent of the outstanding balance of the ABS between November 15, 2011 and April 16, 2012. If the issue is called on November 15, 2011, which the Company believes is probable; the effective cost of the financing will be approximately 1-month LIBOR plus 3.7 percent. This transaction was TALF-eligible. On July 2, 2009, the Company priced a $1.1 billion Private Education Loan securitization which closed on July 14, 2009. The issue bears a coupon of Prime plus 1.25 percent and is callable at the issuer’s option at 94 percent of the outstanding balance of the ABS between January 16, 2012 and June 15, 2012. If the issue is called on January 16, 2012, which the Company believes is probable; the effective cost of the financing will be approximately Prime minus 0.71 percent. This transaction was TALF-eligible. On August 5, 2009, the Company priced a $1.7 billion Private Education Loan securitization which closed on August 13, 2009. The issue bears a coupon of Prime plus 0.25 percent and is callable at the issuer’s option at 94 percent of the outstanding balance of the ABS between August 15, 2013 and July 15, 2014. If the issue is called on August 15, 2013, which the Company believes is probable; the effective cost of the financing will be approximately Prime minus 0.55 percent. This transaction was TALF-eligible. These securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings. The Company has concluded that it is probable it will call these bonds at the call date at the respective discount. Probability is based on the Company’s assessment of whether these bonds can be refinanced at the call date at or lower than a breakeven cost of funds based on the call discount. As a result, the Company is accreting this call discount as a reduction to interest expense through the call date. If it becomes less than probable the Company will call these bonds at a future date it will result in the Company reversing this prior accretion as a cumulative catch up. The Company has accreted approximately $33 million as a reduction of interest expense through September 30, 2009. Consolidation of Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations In the second quarter of 2009, three of the Company’s off-balance sheet securitization trusts were re-evaluated and it was determined that they no longer met the criteria to be considered QSPEs. These trusts were then evaluated as VIEs and it was determined that they should be consolidated and accounted for as secured borrowings as the Company is the primary beneficiary. These trusts had reached their 10 percent clean-up call levels but the call was not exercised by the Company. Because the Company can now exercise that option at its discretion going forward, the Company effectively controls the assets of the trusts. This resulted in the Company consolidating at fair value $454 million in assets and $432 million in liabilities related to these trusts. This resulted in an $11 million gain being recognized during the second quarter of 2009. "

Arrangements The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of
convertible senior notes (the Notes) due in 2014. As of September
30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the Notes
had been satisfied. Therefore, no share amounts related
to the conversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants sold in
connection with the issuance of the Notes were included in diluted
average shares outstanding. On July 1, 2009, the Company began accounting for the Notes in
accordance with the amended guidance in ASC Topic 470-20,
Debt with
Conversion and Other Options, pertaining to convertible debt
instruments with cash settlement features.The amendment addresses
the accounting for convertible debt securities that, upon
conversion, may be settled by the issuer fully or partially in
cash. Previously, most forms of convertible debt securities were
treated solely as debt. Under the new guidance, issuers of
convertible debt securities within its scope must separate these
securities into two accounting components; a debt component,
representing the issuers contractual obligation to pay principal
and interest; and an equity component, representing the holders
option to convert the debt security into equity of the issuer or,
if the issuer so elects, an equivalent amount of cash. The amended guidance required retrospective application to all
periods presented. The following tables reflect the
Companys previously reported amounts, along with adjustments
required by the amended guidance: Consolidated Statement of Earnings Impact Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 As Originally Adjustment due to Reported Topic 470-20 As Adjusted (In millions, except per share amounts) Interest expense reported in Other income  net $ 129 $ 9 $ 138 Income taxes 444 (4 ) 440 Basic and diluted earnings per common share 1.63 (0.01 ) 1.62 Consolidated Balance Sheet Impact June 30, 2009 As Originally Adjustment due to Reported Topic 470-20 As Adjusted (In millions) Other assets $ 610 $ (3 ) $ 607 Long-term debt 7,800 (208 ) 7,592 Deferred income taxes 230 78 308 Common stock 5,022 182 5,204 Reinvested earnings 8,832 (54 ) 8,778 The Company also has outstanding $1.75 billion principal amount of
Equity Units (the Units) due in 2011. The Units are a
combination of (a) debt and (b) forward purchase contracts for the
holder to purchase the Companys common stock. The
forward purchase contracts issued in connection with the Units will
be settled for the Companys common stock no later than June 1,
2011. Until settlement of the forward purchase
contracts, the shares of stock underlying each forward purchase
contract are not outstanding. The forward purchase
contracts will only be included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share to the extent they are dilutive. As
of September 30, 2009, the forward purchase contracts were not
considered dilutive and therefore were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share. At September 30, 2009, the fair value of the Companys long-term
debt exceeded the carrying value by $767 million, as estimated
using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on
the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types
of borrowing arrangements. For further information on the Notes and Units and additional
information on the impact of ASC Topic 470-20 (formerly FSP APB
14-1), refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

7. LONG-TERM
DEBT The Company has
two types of debt reported on its condensed consolidated balance
sheet: non-recourse and recourse debt. Non-recourse debt is used to
fund investments and capital expenditures for the construction and
acquisition of electric power plants, wind projects and
distribution companies at our subsidiaries. Non-recourse debt is
generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts
and cash flows of the related subsidiary. The default risk is
limited to the respective business and is without recourse to the
Parent Company and other subsidiaries. Recourse debt is direct
borrowings by the Parent Company and is used to fund development,
construction or acquisitions, including serving as funding for
equity investments or loans to the affiliates. The Parent
Company’s debt is among other things, recourse to the Parent
Company and is structurally subordinated to the affiliates’
debt. Recourse and
non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The following
table summarizes the carrying amount and fair value of the
Company’s recourse and non-recourse debt as of
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008: September 30,

of non-recourse debt is estimated differently depending upon the
type of loan. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated using
quoted market prices or a discounted cash flow analysis. For
variable rate loans, carrying value typically approximates fair
value. At December 31, 2008, credit spreads were significantly
above historic levels. For the U.S. Dollar, Euro and British
Pound markets where the Company believed the expanded credit spread
was material, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow
analysis. The increase in credit spreads was calculated as the
difference between composite fair value curves, published by
pricing services for the relevant issuer credit rating, and London
Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). For all other
currencies, the Company continued to assume the carrying value was
equal to fair value. During the second and third quarters of 2009,
credit spreads returned to a typical range for all currencies and
the Company concluded that carrying value approximated fair value
for all of our variable rate debt as of September 30,
2009. The fair value
was determined using available market information as of
September 30, 2009. The Company is not aware of any factors
that would significantly affect the fair value amounts subsequent
to September 30, 2009. Non-Recourse
Debt Subsidiary
non-recourse debt in default or accelerated, including any
temporarily waived default, is classified as current debt in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The following
table summarizes the Company’s subsidiary non-recourse debt
in default or accelerated as of September 30, 2009: Primary Nature
of Default September 30, 2009 Subsidiary Default Net Assets (in
millions) Kelanitissa Covenant $
45 $ 14 Ebute (1) Covenant 8 160 Total $ 53 (1) Ebute, our subsidiary in Nigeria, received a waiver of default
on September 18, 2008. The waiver gives Ebute until
December 31, 2009 to cure the breached covenants; however, as
this waiver does not extend beyond the Company’s current
reporting cycle and the probability of curing the default cannot be
determined, the debt was classified as current. None of the
subsidiaries that are currently in default is a material subsidiary
under the Parent Company’s corporate debt agreements which
would trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such
indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of
assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or
other matters in the future that may impact the Company’s
financial position and results of operations, it is possible that
one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition
of a “material subsidiary”, and thereby, upon an
acceleration of its non-recourse debt, trigger an event of default
and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent
Company’s outstanding debt agreements. On
April 8, 2009, AES Gener S.A. (“Gener”) issued
$196 million aggregate principal amount of 8% unsecured notes due
in 2019. The unsecured notes were priced at a discount to par
resulting in an 8.5% yield. The proceeds from this issuance are
being used to meet Gener’s funding requirements for projects
under construction.
Recourse
Debt On
March 26, 2009, the Parent Company and certain subsidiary
guarantors amended the Parent Company’s existing senior
secured credit facility pursuant to the terms of Amendment
No. 1 (“Amendment No. 1”) to the Fourth
Amended and Restated Credit and Reimbursement Agreement, dated as
of July 29, 2008 (the “senior secured credit
facility”). The senior secured credit facility previously
included a $200 million term loan facility maturing on
August 10, 2011 and a $750 million revolving credit facility
maturing on June 23, 2010 (the “revolving credit
facility”). The principal
modification set forth in Amendment No. 1 was a one-year
extension of $570 million of revolving credit facility commitments
from an original maturity date of June 23, 2010 to
July 5, 2011. In addition, certain lenders determined that
they would increase their commitment under the revolving credit
facility by $35 million from March 26, 2009 through
July 5, 2011. Accordingly, Amendment No. 1 increased the
size of the revolving credit facility from $750 million to $785
million through June 23, 2010. From June 23, 2010 through
July 5, 2011, the revolving credit facility size will be $605
million. No modifications were made to the amount or maturity date
of the $200 million term loan facility. The extended
commitments from this amendment were subject to new pricing that
included an upfront fee of 1.25% for participating in the
extensions and an increase in undrawn commitment fees from 50 to
100 basis points. The annual interest rate on the drawn loans was
also increased by 200 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.50%. Pricing and
all other material terms remain unchanged for the revolving credit
facility commitments which have not been extended. On
April 2, 2009 the Parent Company issued $535 million aggregate
principal amount of 9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2016 in a
private placement. The notes were priced at a discount to yield
11%. Subsequently, the Parent Company allocated a substantial
portion of the proceeds to voluntarily reduce the size of its $600
million senior unsecured credit facility among the Parent Company,
Merrill Lynch Bank USA and the banks party thereto (the
“senior unsecured credit facility”). At
September 30, 2009, the remaining commitments under the senior
unsecured credit facility were $108 million, which consisted
primarily of letters of credit, the majority of which supported a
project under construction in Bulgaria. On October 7, 2009,
the Parent Company voluntarily reduced all of the remaining
commitments available under the senior unsecured credit facility
and terminated the facility agreement. The outstanding letters of
credit under the senior unsecured credit facility were transferred
to the senior secured credit facility. On June 1,
2009, the Parent Company repaid at maturity all of its outstanding
9.5% senior unsecured notes at par for an aggregate principal
amount of $154 million.

We extinguished 2.0 billion yen (par value) of our Uridashi notes due September 2016 at a cost of 1.4 billion yen, yielding a gain of .6 billion yen. We extin
guished 3.4 billion yen (par value) of our Samurai notes due June 2012 at a cost of 2.5 billion yen, yielding a gain of .9 billion yen. We extinguished .6 billion yen (par v
alue) of our Samurai notes due July 2010 at a cost of .5 billion yen, yielding a gain of .1 billion yen. Through these transactions, we realized a total gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after-tax), which we included in other income. We did not extinguish any debt during the third quarter of 2009. In April 2009, we used internally generated cash flow to pay off our $450 million senior notes upon their maturity. In May 2009, we issued $850 million of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering. These notes pay interest semi-annually and have a 10-year maturity. The notes are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) the principal amount of the notes or (ii) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In July 2009, we executed a 10 billion yen loan (approximately $111 million using the September 30, 2009, exchange rate) at an interest rate of 3.60%. Interest on the loan is payable semiannually, and the loan has a six-year maturity. In August 2009, we executed a 5 billion y
en loan (approximately $55 million using the September 30, 2009, exchange rate) at an interest rate of 3.00%. Interest on the loan is payable semiannually, and the loan has a six-year maturity. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at September 30, 2009. No events of default or defaults occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. For additional information, see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our annual report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2008."

pted ASC Topic 470-20, which revises the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion. The standard requires issuers of convertible debt instruments within its scope to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. Specifically, it requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the issuer’s consolidated results of operations. The Company was required to apply this new standard to its 1.5% convertible debentures issued in 2004 and due in 2024 (1.5% Convertible Debentures) and its 2.5% convertible debentures issued in 2006 and due in 2026 (2.5% Convertible Debe
ntures). The bifurcation of the instruments was based on estimated market borrowing rates of 4.85% and 5.9%, respectively, for non-convertible debt instruments similar to the 1.5% and 2.5% Convertible Debentures. The discount assigned to the convertible debentures in order to result in interest expense equal to the nonconvertible debt borrowing rates mentioned above is being accreted to interest expense over an estimated five-year life of the convertible debentures. The estimated life is consistent with an option in the debentures allowing holders to require the Company to repurchase the debentures in whole or in part for principal plus accrued and unpaid inter
est five years following the date of issuance. Accordingly, as a result of the adoption of the new standard, interest expense for the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 increased by $3,783,000 and $11,955,000, respectively. The Company has also retrospectively revised certain amounts included in these financial statements for the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008 as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 Increase in interest expense $ 5,259 $ 15,595 Decrease in net income 3,321 160; 9,848 Decrease in basic earnings per share &lt
;td valign=""bottom"" width=""1%"" style=""TEXT-ALIGN: left""> .01 .05 Decrease in diluted earnings per share .02 .05 Approximately $65,802,000 has been included in capital in excess of par value on the Company’s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets at both September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 related to the conversion value of the Company’s 1.5% and 2.5% Convertible Debentures. On June 18, 2009, the Company notified the holders of its 1.5% Convertible Debentures that it would exercise its right to redeem for cash all of the outstanding notes on July 20, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including the redemption date. All of the remaining 1.5% Convertible Debentures were either converted by the holders or redeemed by the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, approximately 3,156,891 shares of common stock were issued to holders of the 1.5% Convertible Debentures who elected the conversion option in recognition of the conversion value of those debentures. The carrying value of the 2.5% Convertible Debentures, totaling $473,411,000, has been classified as long-term debt in the September 30, 2009 Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as these debentures are not redeemable by holders until June 2011. At September 30, 2009, the conversion value of the 2.5% Convertible Debentures did not exceed the principal amount of the debentures. At September 30, 2009, the Company had borrowings outstanding totaling £20,000,000, under its revolving credit facility at an interest rate of 0.
72% with a maturity date of October 20, 2009. Other debt, totaling $23,508,000 at September 30, 2009 consists primarily of short-term borrowings at certain other international locations. At September 30, 2009, the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate debt (based on level 1 quoted market rates) was approximately $1,456,211,000 as compared to $1,250,000,000 principal amount of the debt. The carrying value of all other financial instruments is considered to be representative of their respective fair values. "

DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES Material changes, if any, to Progress Energy’s, PEC’s and PEF’s debt and credit facilities and financing activities since December 31, 2008, are as follows: On January 15, 2009, PEC issued $600 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 5.30% Series due 2019. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the maturity of PEC’s $400 million 5.95% Senior Notes, due March 1, 2009. The remaining proceeds were used to repay PEC’s outstanding short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. On February 3, 2009, the Parent repaid $100 million of the $600 million outstanding balance at December 31, 2008, borrowed under its RCA with proceeds from its 14.4 million share common stock issuance discussed in Note 6D. During the third quarter of 2009, the Parent further reduced the outstanding RCA balance by $300 million with cash on hand, resulting in an outstanding balance of $200 million at September 30, 2009. Subsequent to September 30, 2009, the Parent repaid an additional $100 million of the outstanding balance with proceeds from commercial paper borrowings. At November 6, 2009, the outstanding balance of the RCA loan was $100 million. We will continue to monitor the commercial paper and short-term credit markets to determine when to repay the remaining outstanding balance of the RCA loan, while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. On March 19, 2009, the Parent issued an aggregate $750 million of Senior Notes consisting of $300 million of 6.05% Senior Notes due 2014 and $450 million of 7.05% Senior Notes due 2019. A portion of the proceeds was used to fund PEF’s capita
l expenditures through an equity contribution with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes. On June 18, 2009, PEC entered into a Seventy-seventh Supplemental Indenture to its Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated May 1, 1940, as supplemented, in connection with certain amendments to the mortgage. The amendments are set forth in the Seventy-seventh Supplemental Indenture and include an amendment to extend the maturity date of the mortgage by 100 years. The maturity date of the mortgage is now May 1, 2140. "

In January 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal
amount of notes due in 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $1.0
billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the
“2039 Notes”) in a registered offering. The 2019 Notes
and the 2039 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.70% and
6.40%, respectively. The 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes may be
redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of
the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and a “make-whole” amount, as
defined. Upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering
event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a
portion of the 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes at a price equal to
101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest.
The total debt discount on issuance and debt issuance costs were $7
million and $13 million, respectively, and are being amortized over
the lives of the notes. Convertible
notes
Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting
standard that changed the method of accounting for certain types of
convertible debt and, as required by this new standard, we
retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior
periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt
(see Note 2, “Change in method of accounting for
convertible debt instruments”). Under this method of
accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible notes
are bifurcated and accounted for separately. The equity components
of our convertible notes, including our 2011 Convertible Notes,
2013 Convertible Notes and 2032 Modified Convertible Notes, are
included in “Common stock and additional paid-in
capital” in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a
corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible
notes as of the date of issuance or modification, as applicable.
The reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being
accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of
non-cash interest expense. This results in recognizing interest
expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what
we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with
otherwise similar terms.
The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were
issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%,
respectively. The discounts associated with these notes resulting
from the adoption of this new accounting standard are being
amortized over periods that end on the scheduled maturity dates of
these notes and result in effective interest rates of approximately
6.24% for the 2011 Convertible Notes and approximately 6.35% for
the 2013 Convertible Notes.
For both the three and nine months ended September 30,
2009 and 2008, interest expense for the 2011 Convertible Notes was
approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively, based on the
contractual coupon rates. For both the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2009 and 2008, interest expense for the 2013
Convertible Notes was approximately $2 million and $7 million,
respectively, based on the contractual coupon rates.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009,
amortization of the discount for the 2011 Convertible Notes was
approximately $34 million and $101 million, respectively. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, amortization
of the discount for the 2011 Convertible Notes was approximately
$33 million and $96 million, respectively. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2009, amortization of the discount
for the 2013 Convertible Notes was approximately $30 million and
$88 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2008, amortization of the discount for the 2013
Convertible Notes was approximately $28 million and $82 million,
respectively.
The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may,
subject to certain conditions, be converted based on a conversion
rate of 12.5247 and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000
principal amount of notes (which represents a conversion price of
approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). Upon
conversion, a holder would receive the conversion value, as
defined, in: (i) cash equal to the lesser of the principal
amount of the note or the conversion value and (ii) shares of
our common stock, cash or a combination of shares of our common
stock and cash, at our option, to the extent the conversion value
exceeds the principal amount of the note. As of September 30,
2009, these notes were not convertible and the principal values
exceeded the conversion values.
The principal balances, unamortized discounts and net carrying
amounts of the liability components and the equity components of
our 2011 Convertible Notes and our 2013 Convertible Notes are as
follows (in millions): Liability component Equity

829 The 2032 Modified Convertible Notes were issued in 2005 in
exchange for zero-coupon, 30-year convertible notes that we issued
in 2002. Like the notes for which they were exchanged, no interest
is currently payable on the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes. These
notes were issued at a discount from their principal amount (prior
to the adoption of the new accounting standard). The reduced
carrying value resulting from issuing these notes at a discount is
being accreted back to the principal amount based on a contractual
interest rate of 1.125% over the life of the notes. In March 2007,
substantially all of the holders of the 2032 Modified Convertible
Notes exercised their option to put these convertible notes to us.
The additional discount on the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes
recognized pursuant to the retrospective application of the new
accounting standard (in excess of the discount recognized under the
contractual terms of these securities) was amortized as non-cash
interest expense prior to the holders putting these convertible
notes to us. We continue to recognize interest expense for the
amortization of the discount based on the contractual rate for the
2032 Modified Convertible Notes that remain outstanding. Such
amounts were not material for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2009 and 2008.
Holders of the remaining outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible
Notes may, subject to certain conditions, convert each of their
notes based on a conversion rate of 8.8601 shares of our common
stock. The conversion price per share of the convertible notes as
of any day will equal the accreted value on that day, divided by
the conversion rate, or $87.76, as of September 30, 2009. If
converted, the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes will be settled in
cash for an amount equal to the lesser of the accreted value of the
2032 Modified Convertible Notes at the conversion date or the
conversion value, as defined, and shares of our common stock, if
any, to the extent the conversion value exceeds the amount paid in
cash. As of September 30, 2009, these notes were not
convertible and the accreted value exceeded the amount that would
have been received upon conversion. As of September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, the equity component of the 2032
Modified Convertible Notes was approximately $29
million.
Other
facilities
As of September 30, 2009, we have a $2.3 billion
syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit facility which matures in
November 2012 and is available for general corporate purposes or as
a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. In late 2008,
a participating financial institution in the credit facility, which
had provided $178 million of such commitment declared bankruptcy.
Subsequently, this financial institution, which is a subsidiary of
Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (“Lehman”), was removed
from the credit facility and the aggregate commitment was reduced
to its current level of $2.3 billion.

3. DEBT As of September 30, 2009, the Company had unsecured committed revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling $2.3 billion. The facilities consist of a $1.5 billion facility and a $450 million facility in the U.S., a $200 million facility in Australia and a $150 million facility in Canada. There are no outstanding borrowings or commercial paper at quarter-end, and the full $2.3 billion of unsecured credit facilities is available to the Company. The Company has available a $1.95 billion commercial paper program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under U.S. committed credit facilities, which expire in 2013. One of the Company’s Australian subsidiaries has a secured revolving syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments offshore Western Australia. The facility provides for total commitments of $350 million, with availability determined by a borrowing-base formula. The borrowing base was set at $350 million and will be redetermined after the fields commence production and certain tests have been met, and semi-annually thereafter. The outstanding balance under the facility as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, was $335 million and $100 million. As of September 30, 2009, available borrowing capacity was $15 million. Under the terms of the agreement, the facility amount begins reducing on June 30, 2010 and semi-annually thereafter until maturity on March 31, 2014. The outstanding amount under this facility must not exceed $300 million on June 30, 2010. Accordingly, $35 million of the current balance will be repaid by June 30, 2010 and has been classified as current debt at September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there was $4.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively, borrowed on uncommitted overdraft lines. On March 15, 2009, $100 million of Apache Finance Pty Ltd (Apache Finance Australia) 7.0% notes matured and were repaid using existing cash balances.

Activities
Credit Facilities
and Short-term Borrowings
Our short-term
borrowings may include bank loans, commercial paper, and bank lines
of credit. Short-term borrowings mature within one year from the
date of issuance. We pay commitment fees to banks for providing us
lines of credit. When we borrow under the lines of credit, we pay
market interest rates.
Constellation

Constellation Energy
had bank and other lines of credit under committed unsecured credit
facilities totaling $5.8 billion at September 30, 2009
for short-term financial needs. We enter into these facilities to
ensure adequate liquidity to support our operations. Our
liquidity requirements are funded with credit facilities and cash.
We fund our short-term working capital needs with existing cash and
with our credit facilities, many of which support direct cash
borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, if available. We
also use our credit facilities to support the issuance of letters
of credit, primarily for our merchant energy business. We

commodity-linked credit facility discussed below due to its
contingent nature. During
the third quarter of 2009, we executed a committed five year
bilateral credit facility that allows for a maximum capacity of
$500 million. This facility can be used to issue letters of credit
in support of our collateral obligations. At September 30,
2009 and November 3, 2009, this facility had committed
capacity of $250 million and $500 million, respectively.
The facility partially replaces a portion of our credit facilities
that terminate upon closing of the transaction with EDF. During
the third quarter of 2009, we also entered into a five year
commodity-linked credit facility that allows for the issuance of
letters of credit up to a maximum capacity of $500 million. We
could increase the maximum facility size to $750 million or
alternatively enter into an additional $250 million bilateral
facility if certain conditions are met, including the closing of
the transaction with EDF. This commodity-linked facility is
designed to help manage our contingent collateral requirements
associated with the hedging of our Customer Supply operations
because its capacity increases as natural gas price levels decrease
compared to a reference price that is adjusted periodically. As of
September 30, 2009, there were no letters of credit
outstanding under this facility. BGE
As of
September 30, 2009, BGE has a $400.0 million five-year
revolving credit facility expiring in 2011. BGE can borrow directly
from the banks, use the facility to allow commercial paper to be
issued, if available, or issue letters of credit. On
October 29, 2009, BGE expanded its borrowing capacity to
$575 million. The size of the facility may be increased up to
$600 million with additional commitments by lenders. As of
September 30, 2009, BGE had $0.5 million in letters of
credit issued under this facility. In
addition, at September 30, 2009, BGE had $334.9 million
in commercial paper outstanding.
Debt
Constellation
Energy
In July 2009, we
entered into a three year asset-based lending agreement associated
with certain upstream gas properties that we own. At
September 30, 2009, the borrowing base committed under the
facility was $30 million, of which $12.1 million has been
utilized and reflected in ""Long-term debt"" in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The size of the facility may be increased up to
$200 million with additional commitments by the lenders. At
October 30, 2009, the borrowing base of the facility increased
to $100 million with the commitments of additional lenders. Any
debt issued under this facility is secured by the upstream gas
properties, and the lenders do not have recourse against
Constellation Energy in the event of a default. Interest is payable
quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This
asset-based lending agreement contains a provision that requires
certain of our entities that own our upstream gas properties to
maintain a current ratio of one-to-one. As of September 30,
2009, these entities were in compliance with this
provision.

the close of the EDF transaction, the amount and composition of our
liquidity will change due to the reduction in credit facilities
discussed on the previous page, as well as the receipt of net cash
proceeds from the transaction. The
net proceeds from this transaction are expected to be approximately
$2.2 billion after repayment of the EDF preferred stock and
the payment of taxes. We anticipate using these proceeds to reduce
up to $850 million of our long-term debt, as well as for other
general corporate purposes, including payments related to BGE under
the Maryland PSC order dated October 30, 2009. These net
proceeds will partially offset the reduction in credit facilities,
although our net available liquidity will be reduced.
Other Sources of
Liquidity
In December 2008,
we executed an Investment Agreement with EDF that includes an asset
put arrangement that provides us with an option at any time through
December 31, 2010 (or the termination of the Investment
Agreement by EDF if we breach that agreement) to sell certain
non-nuclear generation assets, at pre-agreed prices, to EDF for
aggregate proceeds of no more than $2 billion pre-tax, or
approximately $1.4 billion after-tax. The amount of after-tax
proceeds will be impacted by the assets actually sold and the
related tax impacts at that time. Exercise
of the put arrangement is conditioned upon the receipt of
regulatory approvals and third-party consents, the absence of any
material liens on such assets, and the absence of a material
adverse effect, as defined in the Investment Agreement. During
April 2009, we received regulatory approvals and consents for
the majority of the assets covered by the put arrangement. As of
September 30, 2009, we have approximately $1.1 billion
after-tax of liquidity available through the put arrangement. We
expect to receive regulatory approval for an additional asset in
the first quarter of 2010, which will increase the net after-tax
liquidity from the put arrangement to approximately
$1.4 billion. We
continue to increase available liquidity and to reduce our business
risk. Specifically, we are reducing capital spending and ongoing
expenses, scaling down the expected variability in long-term
earnings and short-term collateral usage, and limiting our exposure
to business activities that require contingent capital support.
During 2009, we made progress on several of these initiatives as
discussed in more detail in the
Divestitures section
beginning on page 16 and the Variable
Interest Entities section on
page 13. As of September 30, 2009, we have realized
substantially all of the $1 billion of the net reduction in
collateral that was expected from the divestiture of these
operations. We
believe that the actions that we have taken and our current net
available liquidity will be sufficient to support the ongoing
liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. Our liquidity
projections include assumptions for commodity price changes, which
are subject to significant volatility, and we are exposed to
certain operational risks that could have a significant impact on
our liquidity.
Credit Facility
Compliance and Covenants
The credit facilities
of Constellation Energy and BGE have limited material adverse
change clauses, none of which would prohibit draws under the
existing facilities. Certain
credit facilities of Constellation Energy contain a provision
requiring Constellation Energy to maintain a ratio of debt to
capitalization equal to or less than 65%. At September 30,
2009, the debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the credit
agreements was 46%. Upon
the closing of our transaction with EDF, under our
$3.85 billion credit facility (which reduces to
$2.32 billion), we will grant a lien on certain of our
generating facilities and pledge our ownership interests in our
nuclear business to the lenders. Our
$1.23 billion credit facility requires us to maintain
consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization to consolidated interest expense ratio of at least
2.75 when our S&P senior unsecured debt rating is BBB- or lower
and our Moody's senior unsecured debt rating is Baa3 or lower.
Compliance with the covenant was not required as of
September 30, 2009 as S&P's senior unsecured debt rating
was above BBB-. Since the $1.23 billion credit facility expires
upon the earlier of the closing of the EDF transaction or
November 12, 2009, the recent change in rating by S&P to
BBB- will not require compliance with this covenant. The
credit agreement of BGE contains a provision requiring BGE to
maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than
65%. At September 30, 2009, the debt to capitalization ratio
for BGE as defined in this credit agreement was 52%. The
impact of a credit ratings downgrade on our financial ratios
associated with our credit facility covenants would depend on our
financial condition at the time of such a downgrade and on the
source of funds used to satisfy the incremental collateral
obligation resulting from a credit ratings downgrade. For example,
if we were to use existing cash balances or exercise the put option
with EDF to fund the cash portion of any additional collateral
obligations resulting from a credit ratings downgrade, we would not
expect a material impact on our financial ratios. However, if we
were to issue long-term debt or use our credit facilities to fund
any additional collateral obligations, our financial ratios could
be materially affected. Failure by Constellation Energy, or BGE, to
comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of the
maturity of the borrowings outstanding and preclude us from issuing
letters of credit under these
facilities.

NOTE D — BORROWINGS AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS We had total debt of $6.030 billion as of September 30, 2009 and $6.745 billion as of December 31, 2008.

6,050 Note: The table above does not include discounts associated with our Abbott loan and senior notes, or amounts related to certain interest rate swaps that were used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes. In February 2009, we amended our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement to increase flexibility under our financial covenants. The amendment provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the amended agreement, through the credit agreement maturity in April 2011, of up to $346 million in restructuring charges; an exclusion for any litigation-related charges and credits until such items are paid or received; and an exclusion of up to $1.137 billion of any cash payments for litigation settlements or damage awards (net of any litigation payments received), and all cash payments (net of cash receipts) related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements before January 1, 2009. In addition, the agreement provides for an increase in interest rates on our term loan borrowings from LIBOR plus 1.00 percent to LIBOR plus 1.75 percent at current credit ratings. Further, the interest rate on unused facilities increased from 0.175 percent to 0.500 percent. In connection with the amendment of our term loan and revolving credit facility, we reduced availability under our credit facility by $250 million to $1.750 billion. In 2008, we issued a $717 million surety bond backed by a $702 million letter of credit under our revolving credit facility, and $15 million of cash to secure a damage award related to the Johnson & Johnson patent infringement case described in Note L — Commitments and Contingencies. In October 2009, we satisfied the related obligation of $716 million using cash generated from operations, and now have full access to our $1.750 billion credit facility. We also maintain a $350 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. Use of the borrowings is unrestricted. Borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of eligible receivables, concentration of eligible receivables and other factors. During the third quarter of 2009, we extended the maturity of this facility to August 2010. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of September 30, 2009 or December 31, 2008. Further, we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 18.5 billion Japanese yen (translated to approximately $205 million as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008). We discounted notes receivable of $200 million as of September 30, 2009 and $190 million as of December 31, 2008. Discounted notes receivable are excluded from accounts receivable in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. We prepaid $225 million of our term loan during the third quarter of 2009 and $725 million during the first nine months of 2009. We prepaid $250 million of our term loan during the third quarter of 2008 and $1.175 billion in the first nine months of 2008. In October 2009, we prepaid an additional $250 million of our term loan. As a result, our next debt maturity is in 2011. Our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows: Covenant Actual as of Requirement September 30, 2009 Maximum leverage ratio (1) 3.5 times 2.6 times Minimum interest coverage ratio (2) 3.0 times 5.9 times (1) Ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as amended, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. (2) Ratio of EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as amended, to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Our inability to maintain these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers. "

Borrowings Short-Term Borrowings 2007
Facility In August 2007,
the Company entered into a five-year $2,500 unsecured revolving
credit facility (“the 2007 facility”). The 2007
facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage
ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt
less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at
September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009, the Company
had $200 outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate
of 0.43% and a maturity during November 2009. Lehman Commercial
Paper, Inc. has a $140 participation under the 2007 facility;
however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper,
Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. Bank of
America, a related party, has a $140 participation under the 2007
facility. Japan
Commitment-line In June 2009,
BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, renewed its five billion Japanese yen commitment-line
agreement (the “Japan Commitment-line”) for a term of
one year. The Japan Commitment-line is intended to provide
liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At
September 30, 2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding
under the Japan Commitment-line. Convertible Debentures The carrying

discount. At September 30, 2009, the estimated fair value of
the convertible debentures was $532, which was estimated using a
market price at the end of September 2009. On
February 15, 2009, the convertible debentures became
convertible at the option of the holder into cash and shares of the
Company’s common stock at any time prior to maturity.
Subsequent to February 15, 2009, holders of $2 of debentures
elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. In
addition, during October 2009, holders of $5 of debentures elected
to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Long-Term

(e) During the first four years, the Company may redeem the debt at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a “make whole” premium, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

(i) The 2009 Securitized Notes consist of $175 million of principal that amortizes during the period beginning in January 2010 and ending in 2019, and $75 million of principal that amortizes during the period beginning in 2019 and ending in 2029.&

Revolver In January 2009, the Revolver was amended to extend the maturity from January 2009 to January 2010 with a total revolving commitment of $188.0 million. The Company paid an extension fee of $9.9 million, but the credit spreads were not impacted by this amendment. As of September 30, 2009, the Revolver was undrawn, and there was $188.0 million of availability under the Revolver. 9% Senior Notes In January 2009, the Company issued $900.0 million principal amount of 9% senior notes (“9% Senior Notes”) in a public offering pursuant to an indenture. These 9% Senior Notes are general obligations of CCIC, which rank equally with all existing and future senior debt of CCIC. The 9% Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all liabilities (including trade payables) of each subsidiary of the Company. The proceeds from the 9% Senior Notes were $795.7 million, net of fees and discounts. The Company may use these net proceeds for general corporate purposes. As discussed below, the Company has used the net proceeds to (1) purchase portions of its previously existing 2004 Mortgage Loan, (2) repay and purchase portions of its previously existing 2006 Mortgage Loan in April 2009, and (3) repay the Revolver. The 9% Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants with which the Company and its restricted subsidiaries must comply, subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications, including restrictions on its ability to incur incremental debt, issue pref
erred stock, guarantee debt, pay dividends, repurchase its capital stock, use assets as security in other transactions, sell assets or merge with or into other companies, and make certain investments. Certain of these covenants are not applicable if there is no event of default and if the ratio of the Company’s Consolidated Debt (as defined in the 9% Senior Notes indenture) to its Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flows (as defined in the 9% Senior Notes indenture) is less than or equal to 7.0 to 1.0. The 9% Senior Notes do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. 7.75% Secured Notes On April 30, 2009, two indirect subsidiaries of the Company (&
amp;#8220;7.75% Notes Issuers”) issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 7.75% secured notes (“7.75% Secured Notes”) due 2017 pursuant to an indenture. The 7.75% Secured Notes are guaranteed by the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the 7.75% Notes Issuers (“Guarantors”). These 7.75% Secured Notes are secured on a first priority basis by a pledge of the equity interests of the Guarantors and by certain other assets of such subsidiaries. The 7.75% Secured Notes are obligations of the subsidiaries that were obligated under the 2006 Mortgage Loan, which was repaid in part through the proceeds from the 7.75% Secured Notes. The 7.75% Secured Notes are not guaranteed by and are not obligations of CCIC or any of its subsidiaries other than the 7.75% Notes Issuers and Guarantors. The 7.75% Secured Notes will be paid solely from the cash flows generated from operations of the towers held directly and indirectly by the issuers and the Guarantors.
The proceeds from these 7.75% Secured Notes were $1.15 billion net of fees and discounts. The Company has used the net proceeds, along with other cash, to repay the 2006 Mortgage Loan. The 7.75% Secured Notes contain restrictive covenants with which the issuing subsidiaries and the Guarantors must comply, subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications, including restrictions on their ability to incur debt, make restricted payments, incur liens, enter into certain merger or change of control transactions, enter into related party transactions and engage in certain other activities as set forth in the indenture. The 7.75% Secured Notes contain financial covenants that could result in cash being depos
ited in a reserve account and require the Company to offer to purchase the 7.75% Secured Notes. 2009 Securitized Notes On July 31, 2009, indirect subsidiaries of the Company (“2009 Securitized Notes Issuers”) issued $250 million principal amount of senior secured notes, series 2009-1 (“2009 Securitized Notes”) pursuant to an indenture. The 2009 Securitized Notes are secured by, among other things, (1) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property of the 2009 Securitized Notes Issuers, (2) a pledge of the equity interests of the subsidiaries holding such towers, and (3) a security interest in the 2009 Securitized Notes Issuers’ contracts with customers to lease space on their towers (space licenses). The 2009 Securitized Notes are obligations of the subsidiaries that were obligated under the 2004 Mortgage Loan, which was repaid in part through proceeds of the 2009 Securitized Notes. The 2009 Securitized Notes are not guaranteed by and are not obligations of CCIC or any of its subsidiaries other than the 2009 Securitized Notes Issuers and the indirect subsidiary of the Company that is the parent of the 2009 Securitized Notes Issuers and a guarantor of the 2009 Securitized Notes. The 2009 Securitized Notes will be paid solely from the cash flows generated from operations of the towers held by the issuers of the 2009 Securitized Notes. The Company has used the net proceeds to repay the portion of the 2004 Mortgage Loan not previously purchased. The Company may prepay the 2009 Securitized Notes in whole or in part at any time after the second anniversary of the closing date, provided such prepayment is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration. The indenture governing the 2009 Securitized Notes contains covenants and restrictions customary for rated securitizations, including provisions prohibiting the issuers from incurring additional indebtedness or further encumbering their assets. The 2009 Securitized Notes contain financial covenants that could result in cash being deposited in a reserve account, with such cash being applied to repay the debt. Contractual Maturities The following are the scheduled contractual maturities of the total debt and other long-term obligations outstanding at September 30, 2009, exclusive of the 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock. These maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the Tower Revenue Notes. If the Tower Revenue Notes are not paid in full on or prior to June 2010 or November 2011, respectively, then Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture) of the Issuers (as defined in the indenture) will be used to repay principal of the Tower Revenue Notes, and additional interest (by an additional approximately 5% per annum) will accrue on the Tower Rev
enue Notes. See also note 15. &nbs

commodity-linked credit facility discussed below due to its
contingent nature. During
the third quarter of 2009, we executed a committed five year
bilateral credit facility that allows for a maximum capacity of
$500 million. This facility can be used to issue letters of credit
in support of our collateral obligations. At September 30,
2009 and November 3, 2009, this facility had committed
capacity of $250 million and $500 million, respectively.
The facility partially replaces a portion of our credit facilities
that terminate upon closing of the transaction with EDF. During
the third quarter of 2009, we also entered into a five year
commodity-linked credit facility that allows for the issuance of
letters of credit up to a maximum capacity of $500 million. We
could increase the maximum facility size to $750 million or
alternatively enter into an additional $250 million bilateral
facility if certain conditions are met, including the closing of
the transaction with EDF. This commodity-linked facility is
designed to help manage our contingent collateral requirements
associated with the hedging of our Customer Supply operations
because its capacity increases as natural gas price levels decrease
compared to a reference price that is adjusted periodically. As of
September 30, 2009, there were no letters of credit
outstanding under this facility. BGE
As of
September 30, 2009, BGE has a $400.0 million five-year
revolving credit facility expiring in 2011. BGE can borrow directly
from the banks, use the facility to allow commercial paper to be
issued, if available, or issue letters of credit. On
October 29, 2009, BGE expanded its borrowing capacity to
$575 million. The size of the facility may be increased up to
$600 million with additional commitments by lenders. As of
September 30, 2009, BGE had $0.5 million in letters of
credit issued under this facility. In
addition, at September 30, 2009, BGE had $334.9 million
in commercial paper outstanding.
Debt
Constellation
Energy
In July 2009, we
entered into a three year asset-based lending agreement associated
with certain upstream gas properties that we own. At
September 30, 2009, the borrowing base committed under the
facility was $30 million, of which $12.1 million has been
utilized and reflected in ""Long-term debt"" in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The size of the facility may be increased up to
$200 million with additional commitments by the lenders. At
October 30, 2009, the borrowing base of the facility increased
to $100 million with the commitments of additional lenders. Any
debt issued under this facility is secured by the upstream gas
properties, and the lenders do not have recourse against
Constellation Energy in the event of a default. Interest is payable
quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This
asset-based lending agreement contains a provision that requires
certain of our entities that own our upstream gas properties to
maintain a current ratio of one-to-one. As of September 30,
2009, these entities were in compliance with this
provision.

commodity-linked credit facility due to its contingent
nature. Upon
the close of the EDF transaction, the amount and composition of our
liquidity will change due to the reduction in credit facilities
discussed on the previous page, as well as the receipt of net cash
proceeds from the transaction. The
net proceeds from this transaction are expected to be approximately
$2.2 billion after repayment of the EDF preferred stock and
the payment of taxes. We anticipate using these proceeds to reduce
up to $850 million of our long-term debt, as well as for other
general corporate purposes, including payments related to BGE under
the Maryland PSC order dated October 30, 2009. These net
proceeds will partially offset the reduction in credit facilities,
although our net available liquidity will be reduced.
Other Sources of
Liquidity
In December 2008,
we executed an Investment Agreement with EDF that includes an asset
put arrangement that provides us with an option at any time through
December 31, 2010 (or the termination of the Investment
Agreement by EDF if we breach that agreement) to sell certain
non-nuclear generation assets, at pre-agreed prices, to EDF for
aggregate proceeds of no more than $2 billion pre-tax, or
approximately $1.4 billion after-tax. The amount of after-tax
proceeds will be impacted by the assets actually sold and the
related tax impacts at that time. Exercise
of the put arrangement is conditioned upon the receipt of
regulatory approvals and third-party consents, the absence of any
material liens on such assets, and the absence of a material
adverse effect, as defined in the Investment Agreement. During
April 2009, we received regulatory approvals and consents for
the majority of the assets covered by the put arrangement. As of
September 30, 2009, we have approximately $1.1 billion
after-tax of liquidity available through the put arrangement. We
expect to receive regulatory approval for an additional asset in
the first quarter of 2010, which will increase the net after-tax
liquidity from the put arrangement to approximately
$1.4 billion. We
continue to increase available liquidity and to reduce our business
risk. Specifically, we are reducing capital spending and ongoing
expenses, scaling down the expected variability in long-term
earnings and short-term collateral usage, and limiting our exposure
to business activities that require contingent capital support.
During 2009, we made progress on several of these initiatives as
discussed in more detail in the
Divestitures section
beginning on page 16 and the Variable
Interest Entities section on
page 13. As of September 30, 2009, we have realized
substantially all of the $1 billion of the net reduction in
collateral that was expected from the divestiture of these
operations. We
believe that the actions that we have taken and our current net
available liquidity will be sufficient to support the ongoing
liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. Our liquidity
projections include assumptions for commodity price changes, which
are subject to significant volatility, and we are exposed to
certain operational risks that could have a significant impact on
our liquidity.
Credit Facility
Compliance and Covenants
The credit facilities
of Constellation Energy and BGE have limited material adverse
change clauses, none of which would prohibit draws under the
existing facilities. Certain
credit facilities of Constellation Energy contain a provision
requiring Constellation Energy to maintain a ratio of debt to
capitalization equal to or less than 65%. At September 30,
2009, the debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the credit
agreements was 46%. Upon
the closing of our transaction with EDF, under our
$3.85 billion credit facility (which reduces to
$2.32 billion), we will grant a lien on certain of our
generating facilities and pledge our ownership interests in our
nuclear business to the lenders. Our
$1.23 billion credit facility requires us to maintain
consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization to consolidated interest expense ratio of at least
2.75 when our S&P senior unsecured debt rating is BBB- or lower
and our Moody's senior unsecured debt rating is Baa3 or lower.
Compliance with the covenant was not required as of
September 30, 2009 as S&P's senior unsecured debt rating
was above BBB-. Since the $1.23 billion credit facility expires
upon the earlier of the closing of the EDF transaction or
November 12, 2009, the recent change in rating by S&P to
BBB- will not require compliance with this covenant. The
credit agreement of BGE contains a provision requiring BGE to
maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than
65%. At September 30, 2009, the debt to capitalization ratio
for BGE as defined in this credit agreement was 52%. The
impact of a credit ratings downgrade on our financial ratios
associated with our credit facility covenants would depend on our
financial condition at the time of such a downgrade and on the
source of funds used to satisfy the incremental collateral
obligation resulting from a credit ratings downgrade. For example,
if we were to use existing cash balances or exercise the put option
with EDF to fund the cash portion of any additional collateral
obligations resulting from a credit ratings downgrade, we would not
expect a material impact on our financial ratios. However, if we
were to issue long-term debt or use our credit facilities to fund
any additional collateral obligations, our financial ratios could
be materially affected. Failure by Constellation Energy, or BGE, to
comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of the
maturity of the borrowings outstanding and preclude us from issuing
letters of credit under these
facilities.

has a syndicated five-year committed uncollateralized revolving
line of credit facility with unaffiliated banks totaling
$3.0 billion, which was undrawn at September 30, 2009 and
matures in 2011. CGMHI also has committed long-term financing
facilities with unaffiliated banks. At September 30, 2009,
CGMHI had drawn down the full $900 million available under
these facilities, of which $150 million is guaranteed by
Citigroup. Generally, a bank can terminate these facilities by
giving CGMHI one-year prior notice. The
Company issues both fixed and variable rate debt in a range of
currencies. It uses derivative contracts, primarily interest rate
swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to
variable rate debt and variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The
maturity structure of the derivatives generally corresponds to the
maturity structure of the debt being hedged. In addition, the
Company uses other derivative contracts to manage the impact of FX
translation certain debt issuances. Citigroup
and other U.S. financial services firms are currently benefiting
from government programs that are improving markets and providing
Citigroup and other institutions with significant current funding
capacity and significant liquidity support, including the Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). See ""TARP and Other Regulatory
Programs"" above. Long-term
debt at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 includes
$34.5 billion and $24.1 billion, respectively, of junior
subordinated debt. The Company formed statutory business trusts
under the laws of the state of Delaware. The trusts exist for the

Commercial paper backed by the revolving bridge facility was repaid
in February 2009 with the net proceeds from the 5.75% fixed rate
notes due February 2014. At September 30, 2009, this
represented commercial paper backed by the three-year senior credit
facility. Commercial paper notes with
an aggregate par value of $6.0 billion and maturities ranging from
1 to 94 days were issued during the nine months ended
September 30, 2009. The weighted average discount rates for
commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008 were 0.22% and 2.61%, respectively. During
the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, the weighted average
balance, at par value, of commercial paper outstanding was $677.4
million and $271.0 million, respectively.

facility, to replenish cash used to repay $20 million principal
amount of debt due September 15, 2009 and for general
corporate purposes. In June 2008, Duke Energy

Proceeds from this issuance were used to repay short-term notes and
for general corporate purposes, including funding capital
expenditures. In March 2009, Duke
Energy Indiana issued $450 million principal amount of first
mortgage bonds, which carry a fixed interest rate of 6.45% and

Facilities. The total capacity under Duke Energy’s master
credit facility, which expires in June 2012, is approximately $3.14
billion. The credit facility contains an option allowing borrowing
up to the full amount of the facility on the day of initial
expiration for up to one year. Duke Energy and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy
Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky (collectively referred to as the
borrowers), each have borrowing capacity under the master credit
facility up to specified sub limits for each borrower. However,
Duke Energy has the unilateral ability to increase or decrease the
borrowing sub limits of each borrower, subject to per borrower
maximum cap limitations, at any time. See footnote (c) to the
table below for the borrowing sub limits for each of the borrowers
as of September 30, 2009. The amount available under the
master credit facility has been reduced by draw downs of cash and
the use of the master credit facility to backstop the issuances of
commercial paper, letters of credit and certain pollution control
bonds. Master Credit Facility

Kentucky. In September 2008, Duke
Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas,
Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky,
borrowed a total of approximately $1 billion under Duke
Energy’s master credit facility. The following borrowings
under Duke Energy’s master credit facility remained
outstanding at September 30, 2009: Outstanding
Borrowings
Under Master Credit
Facility (in millions) Duke Energy Corporation $
274 Duke Energy Ohio 279 Duke Energy Indiana 123 Total $
676 The loans under the
master credit facility are revolving credit loans that currently
bear interest at one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
plus an applicable spread ranging from 19 to 23 basis points. The
loan for Duke Energy has a stated maturity of June 2012, while the
loans for all of the other borrowers had stated maturities of
September 2009; however, the borrowers have the ability under the
master credit facility to renew the loans due in September 2009 on
an annual basis up through the date the master credit facility
matures in June 2012. As a result of these annual renewal
provisions, in September 2009, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy
Indiana repaid and immediately re-borrowed approximately $279
million and $123 million, respectively, under the master credit
facility. Duke Energy and Duke Energy Indiana have the intent and
ability to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis, either
through renewal of the terms of the loan through the master credit
facility, which has non-cancelable terms in excess of one-year, or
through issuance of long-term debt to replace the amounts drawn
under the master credit facility. Accordingly, total borrowings by
Duke Energy and Duke Energy Indiana of approximately $397 million
are reflected as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
at both September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008.
Additionally, Duke Energy Kentucky’s borrowings of $74
million, which was repaid in 2009 as discussed above, was included
in Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 31, 2008. As Duke Energy Ohio does not have the
intent to refinance its borrowings on a long-term basis, amounts
outstanding at both September 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008 of approximately $279 million are reflected in Notes Payable
and Commercial Paper within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. At September 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, approximately $918 million and
$779 million, respectively, of pollution control bonds were
classified as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of
this amount, the master credit facility served as a backstop for
approximately $385 million of these pollution control bonds (of
which approximately $100 million is in the form of letters of
credit), with the remaining balance backstopped by other specific
long-term credit facilities separate from the master credit
facility. Additionally, at both September 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, approximately $450 million of commercial
paper issuances were classified as Long-Term Debt on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. These pollution control bonds and
commercial paper issuances, which are short-term obligations by
nature, are classified as long-term due to Duke Energy’s
intent and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term
financing. As Duke Energy’s master credit facility and other
specific purpose credit facilities have non-cancelable terms in
excess of one year as of the balance sheet date, Duke Energy has
the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on a
long-term basis. Restrictive Debt
Covenants. Duke Energy’s debt and credit agreements
contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet
those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in
accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of
September 30, 2009, Duke Energy was in compliance with all
covenants related to its significant debt agreements. In addition,
some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or
termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or the
acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or
some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements
contain material adverse change clauses.

Liabilities and Lines of Credit
Long-Term
Debt
In March 2009, SCE
issued $500 million of 6.05% and $250 million of 4.15%
first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2039 and 2014,
respectively. The bond proceeds were used for general corporate
purposes and to finance fuel inventories.
In February 2009, SCE
repaid $150 million of its first and refunding mortgage bonds.
In March 2009, SCE purchased two issues of its tax-exempt pollution
control bonds totaling $219 million and converted the issues
to a variable rate structure. SCE continues to hold the bonds which
remain outstanding and have not been retired or
cancelled.
In June 2009, EME
completed through its subsidiary, Viento Funding II, Inc., a
non-recourse financing of its interests in the Wildorado, San Juan
Mesa and Elkhorn Ridge wind projects. The financing included a
$189 million seven-year term loan and a $13 million
letter of credit facility which replaced project letters of credit
previously issued under the EME corporate credit
facility.
In July 2009, Viento
Funding II amended the credit agreement to add a working capital
facility. Availability under the working capital facility is
initially $3.8 million and steps up semi-annually to
$5.2 million by maturity. The agreement restricts the use of
proceeds from the working capital facility to operation and
maintenance expenditures at these three wind projects.
In September 2009,
Midwest Generation and EME repaid $200 million and
$163 million, respectively, of borrowings under their
respective credit facilities. The outstanding balances under
Midwest Generation's working capital facility of $275 million
and EME's corporate credit facility of $188 million were
reported as current portion of long-term obligations on EME's
consolidated balance sheet and were repaid in October
2009.

On March 17,
2009, SCE entered into a new $500 million 364-day revolving
credit facility, terminating on March 16, 2010. The additional
liquidity provided by the facility will be used to support SCE's
ongoing power procurement-related needs.
In June 2009, SCE
amended its $2.5 billion five-year credit facility, reducing
the commitment to $2.4 billion, and Edison International
amended its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, reducing
the commitment to $1.4 billion. Both amendments were made to

3. Convertible Debt In November
2006, we issued our Notes for total gross proceeds of $3.45
billion. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank
equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt.
Holders may convert their Notes at their option on any day prior to
the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately
preceding (i) September 1, 2011, with respect to the 2011
Notes, and (ii) September 1, 2013, with respect to the
2013 Notes, in each case only under the following circumstances:
(1) during the five business-day period after any five
consecutive trading-day period (the “measurement
period”) in which the price per Note of the applicable series
for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the
product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the
conversion rate on each such day; (2) during any calendar
quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20
or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in
effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
calendar quarter; or (3) upon the occurrence of certain events
specified in the Notes. Additionally, the Notes will become
convertible during the last three months prior to the respective
maturities of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. Upon
conversion, we will pay cash up to the principal amount of the debt
converted. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the
principal amount of the Notes converted, we have the option to
settle the excess with cash, shares of our common stock, or a
combination of cash and shares of our common stock based on a daily
conversion value, determined in accordance with the indenture,
calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant
20-day observation period. The initial conversion rate for the
Notes will be 62.1978 shares of our common stock per one thousand
dollars of principal amount of Notes, which represents a 27.5%
conversion premium from the date the Notes were issued and is
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $16.08 per share
of our common stock. The conversion price is subject to adjustment
in some events as set forth in the indenture. In addition, if a
“fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture)
occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some cases increase
the conversion rate for a holder of Notes that elects to convert
its Notes in connection with such fundamental change. The Notes pay
interest in cash at a rate of 1.75% semi-annually in arrears on
December 1 and June 1 of each year. In connection
with the sale of the Notes, we entered into separate convertible
note hedge transactions with respect to our common stock (the
“Purchased Options”). The Purchased Options allow us to
receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the
excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the
Notes upon conversion. The Purchased Options will cover, subject to
customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 215 million
shares of our common stock. Half of the Purchased Options expire on
December 1, 2011 and the remaining half of the Purchased
Options expire on December 1, 2013. We paid an aggregate
amount of $669.1 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes
for the Purchased Options. We also entered
into separate transactions in which we sold warrants to acquire,
subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately
215 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
approximately $19.55 per share of our common stock. Half of the
Sold Warrants have expiration dates between February 15, 2012
and March 15, 2012 and the remaining half of the Sold Warrants
have expiration dates between February 18, 2014 and
March 18, 2014. We received aggregate proceeds of $391.1
million from the sale of the Sold Warrants. The Purchased
Options and Sold Warrants will generally have the effect of
increasing the conversion price of the Notes to approximately
$19.55 per share of our common stock, representing an approximate
55% conversion premium based on the closing price of $12.61 per
share of our common stock on November 13, 2006. The carrying
amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2009 for our long-term convertible debt was
$3,072.5 million. The fair value of the long-term convertible debt
as of September 30, 2009 was $4,162.7 million based on active
market prices for the debt. The following

DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES Material changes, if any, to Progress Energy’s, PEC’s and PEF’s debt and credit facilities and financing activities since December 31, 2008, are as follows: On January 15, 2009, PEC issued $600 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 5.30% Series due 2019. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the maturity of PEC’s $400 million 5.95% Senior Notes, due March 1, 2009. The remaining proceeds were used to repay PEC’s outstanding short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. On February 3, 2009, the Parent repaid $100 million of the $600 million outstanding balance at December 31, 2008, borrowed under its RCA with proceeds from its 14.4 million share common stock issuance discussed in Note 6D. During the third quarter of 2009, the Parent further reduced the outstanding RCA balance by $300 million with cash on hand, resulting in an outstanding balance of $200 million at September 30, 2009. Subsequent to September 30, 2009, the Parent repaid an additional $100 million of the outstanding balance with proceeds from commercial paper borrowings. At November 6, 2009, the outstanding balance of the RCA loan was $100 million. We will continue to monitor the commercial paper and short-term credit markets to determine when to repay the remaining outstanding balance of the RCA loan, while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. On March 19, 2009, the Parent issued an aggregate $750 million of Senior Notes consisting of $300 million of 6.05% Senior Notes due 2014 and $450 million of 7.05% Senior Notes due 2019. A portion of the proceeds was used to fund PEF’s capita
l expenditures through an equity contribution with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes. On June 18, 2009, PEC entered into a Seventy-seventh Supplemental Indenture to its Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated May 1, 1940, as supplemented, in connection with certain amendments to the mortgage. The amendments are set forth in the Seventy-seventh Supplemental Indenture and include an amendment to extend the maturity date of the mortgage by 100 years. The maturity date of the mortgage is now May 1, 2140. "

These securities are on-lent to Ford Holdings to fund Financial Services activity and are reported as Financial Services debt. Debt Repurchases. In January 2009, we repurchased through a private market transaction $165 million principal amount of our outstanding public unsecured debt securities for $37 million in cash. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $127 million, net of unamortized discounts, premiums and fees, in Automotive interest income and other non-operating income/(expense), net in the first quarter of 2009. Unsecured Notes Tender Offer. Pursuant to a cash tender offe
r conducted by Ford Credit, on the settlement date of April 8, 2009, Ford Credit purchased $3.4 billion principal amount of our public unsecured debt securities for an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion cash (including transaction costs and accrued and unpaid interest payments for such tendered debt securities). Upon settlement, Ford Credit transferred the repurchased debt securities to us in satisfaction of $1.1 billion of its tax liabilities to us. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.2 billion, net of unamortized discounts, premiums and fees, in Automotive interest income and other non-operating income/(expense), net in the second quarter of 2009. Debt for Equity Exchanges. During the first half of 2008, we issued an aggregate of 46,437,906 shares of Ford Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in exchange for $431 million principal amount of our outstanding public unsecured debt securities. As a result of the exchange, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $73 million, net of unamortized discounts, premiums and fees, in Automotive interest income and other non-operating income/(expense), net. Convertible Notes Pursuant to our December 2006 issuance, at September 30, 2009, we had outstanding $579 million of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.25% per annum. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of Ford Common Stock, based on a conversion rate (subject to adjustment) of 108.6957 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equal to a conversion price of $9.20 per share, representing a 25% conversion premium based on the closin
g price of $7.36 per share on December 6, 2006). Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes for cash on December 20, 2016 and December 15, 2026 or upon a change in control of the Company, or for shares of Ford Common Stock upon a designated event, in each case for a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes at our option at any time or from time to time on or after December 20, 2016 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. We also may terminate the conversion rights at any time on or after December 20,&a
mp;#160;2013 if the closing price of Ford Common Stock exceeds 140% of the then-prevailing conversion price for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period. We applied the guidance for accounting for convertible debt instruments that, upon conversion, may be settled in cash retrospectively to all periods presented following our adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 (see Note 1 for additional detail). The following table summarizes the liability and equity components of our Convertible Notes (in millions): September 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 Liability component Principal $ 579 $ 4,883 Unamortized discount (179 ) (1,619 &l

Pursuant to an exchange offer we conducted, on the settlement date of April 8, 2009, $4.3 billion principal amount of Convertible Notes was exchanged for an aggregate of 467,909,227 shares of Ford Common Stock, $344 million in cash ($80 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes exchanged) and the applicable accrued and unpaid interest on such Convertible Notes. As a result of the conversion, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.2&amp
;#160;billion to Automotive interest income and other non-operating income/(expense), net in the second quarter of 2009. Subsequent Event. On November 3, 2009, we entered into an underwriting agreement for the public issuance of $2.5 billion principal amount of 4.25% Senior Convertible Notes due November 15, 2016. These notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, into Ford Common Stock at a conversion price of approximately $9.30 per share. Upon conversion, we will have the right to deliver, in lie
u of shares of Ford Common Stock, cash or a combination of cash and Common Stock. The transaction is scheduled to settle on November 9, 2009 and will result in net proceeds to us of about $2.44 billion. We have granted the underwriters an option to purchase an additional $375 million in aggregate principal amount of these convertible notes. The liability component will be recorded in Debt, and the equity component will be recorded in Capital in excess of par value of stock. These senior convertible notes will be issued pursuant to our existing effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Net proceeds to us from the senior convertible notes offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. Subordinated Convertible Debentures At September 30, 2009, we had outst
anding $3 billion of 6.50% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2032 (""Subordinated Convertible Debentures"") and $93 million of deferred interest, reported in Automotive long-term debt. The $3 billion of Subordinated Debentures are due to Trust II, a subsidiary trust, and are the sole assets of Trust II. As of January 15, 2007, the Subordinated Convertible Debentures have become redeemable at our option. As announced on March 27, 2009, we elected to defer future interest payments related to the Trust Preferred Securities for up to 5 years. At September 30, 2009, Trust II had outstanding 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities with an aggregate liquidation preference of $2.8 billion (""Trust Preferred Securities""). We guarantee the payment of all distribution and other payments of the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent not paid by Trust II, but only if and to the extent we have made a payment of interest or principal on the Subordinated Convertible Debentures. Trust II is not consolidated by us as it is a VIE in which we do not have a significant variable interest and of which we are not the primary beneficiary. During the first quarter of 2009, pursuant to a request for conversion, we issued an aggregate of 2,437,562 shares of Ford Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in exchange for $43 million principal amount of our Subordinated Convertible Debentures. Secured Term Loan and Revolving Loan Pursuant to our December 2006 Credit Agreement, at September 30,
160;2009, we had outstanding $4.6 billion of a secured term loan maturing on December 15, 2013 and $10.2 billion of revolving loans maturing on December 15, 2011. The term loan principal amount amortizes at a rate of $70 million (1% of original loan) per annum and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00%. The revolving loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%. Under the Credit Agreement, we may designate certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries, including Ford Credit, as borrowers under the revolving facility. We and certain of our domestic subsidiaries that cons
titute a substantial portion of our domestic Automotive assets (excluding cash) are guarantors under the Credit Agreement, and future material domestic subsidiaries will become guarantors when formed or acquired. Collateral. The borrowings of the Company, the subsidiary borrowers, and the guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by a substantial portion of our domestic Automotive assets (excluding cash). The collateral includes a majority of our principal domestic manufacturing facilities, excluding facilities to be closed, subject to limitations set forth in existing public indentures and o
ther unsecured credit agreements; domestic accounts receivable; domestic inventory; up to $4 billion of marketable securities or cash proceeds therefrom; 100% of the stock of our principal domestic subsidiaries, including Ford Credit (but excluding the assets of Ford Credit); certain intercompany notes of Volvo Holding Company Inc., a holding company for Volvo, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited (""Ford Canada"") and Grupo Ford S. de R.L. de C.V. (a Mexican subsidiary); 66% to 100% of the stock of all major first tier foreign subsidiaries (including Volvo); and certain domestic intellectual property, including trademarks. Covenants With respect to the borrowing base covenant, we are required to limit the outstanding amount of debt under the Credit Agreement as well as certain permitted additional indebtedness secured by the collateral described above such that the total debt outstanding does not exceed the value of the collateral as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Events of Default. In addition to customary payment, representation, bankruptcy and judgment defaults, the Credit Agreement contains cross-payment and cross-acceleration defaults with respect to other debt for b
orrowed money and a change in control default. Secured Revolving Loan Draw. Due to concerns about instability in the capital markets and the uncertain state of the global economy, on February 3, 2009, we borrowed $10.1 billion under the revolving credit facility of the Credit Agreement to ensure access to these funds. As expected, the $890 million commitment of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (""LCPI""), one of the lenders under the facility, was not funded because LCPI filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.&
#160;Bankruptcy Code on October 5, 2008. LCPI subsequently assigned $110 million of its revolving commitment to other lenders, and $89 million of these assignee lenders' revolving commitments were funded in the third quarter of 2009. On July 10, 2009, we terminated the remaining LCPI commitment of $780 million. We also received an additional $10 million under the revolving credit facility in the third quarter of 2009 for amounts previously committed but not yet received. Secured Term Loan Repurchase. On March 27, 2009, Ford Credit purchased from the lenders under the Credit Agreement $2.2 billion principal amount of our secured term loan thereunder for an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion (including transaction costs). Consistent with previously-announced plans to return capital from Ford Credit to us, Ford Credit distributed the repurchased secured term loan to its immediate parent, Ford Holdings, whereupon the debt was forgiven. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion in Automotive interest income and other non-operating income/(expense), net in the first quarter of 2009. In July 2009, Ford Leasing purchased from the lenders under the Credit Agreement $45 million principal amount of our secured term loan thereunder for an aggregate cost of $37 million. Ford Holdings elected to receive the $37 million from Ford Leasing as a dividend, whereupon the debt was immediately forgiven. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $8 million in Automotive interest income and other non-operating income/(expense), net in the third quarter of 2009. Subsequent Event. On November 2, 2009, we proposed to the lenders under the Credit Agreement an amendment that would reduce revolving lenders’ revolving commitments, extend the maturity of such lenders’ revolving commitments until 2013 and modify certain covenants and other provisions. Pursuant to the proposal, each revolving lender that agrees to extend the maturity of its revolving commitments may reduce its revolving commitment by up to 25 percent at its election and to the extent its reduced revolving commitment exceeds certain specified levels, such excess would be converted into a new term loan under the Credit Agreement maturing on December 15, 2013. In exchange for a reduction in their revolving commitments, as well as a 1 percentage point increase in interest rate margins, an increase in fees, and payment of an upfront fee, the revolving lenders would agree to extend the maturity of their revolving commitments and loans to November 30, 2013 from December 15, 2011. The modified covenants would expand existing limitations on debt prepayments and repurchases to allow for further balance sheet improvements. We would repay revolving loans to the extent necessary to effect the commitment reductions on December 3, 2009. The revolving lenders are required to submit their responses to our proposal by November 18, 2009. As of the date of this Report, certain revolving lenders have indicated that they intend to accept our proposal and extend about $6 billion of revolving commitments and loans to November 30, 2013. The amendment and extension is subject to approval by lenders holding a majority in principal amount of the loans and commitments outstanding under the Credit Agreement. U.S. Department of Energy Loan Pursuant to the Loan Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement (the ""Arrangement Agreement"") with the U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE"") entered into on September 16, 2009, we have outstanding $886 million in loans. The DOE agreed to (i) arrange a 13-year multi-draw term loan facility (the ""Facility"") under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (""ATVM"") Program in the aggregate principal amount of up to $5.9 billion, (ii) designate us as a borrower under the ATVM Program and (iii) cause the Federal Financing Bank (""FFB"") to enter into the Note Purchase Agreement (the ""Note Purchase Agreement"") for the purchase of notes to be issued by us evidencing such loans under the Arrangement Agreement. Loans under the ATVM will be made by and through the Federal Financing Bank, an instrumentality of the U.S. government that is under the general supervision of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The proceeds of advances under the Facility will be used to finance certain costs eligible for financing under the ATVM Program (""Eligible Project Costs"") that are incurred through mid-2012 in the implementation of 13 advanced technology vehicle programs approved by the DOE (each, a ""Project""). The Arrangement Agreement limits the amount of advances that may be used to fund Eligible Project Costs for each Project, and our ability to finance Eligible Project Costs with respect to a Pr
oject is conditioned on us meeting agreed timing milestones and fuel economy targets for that Project. Maturity, Interest Rate and Amortization. Advances may be requested from September 16, 2009 through June 30, 2012, and the loans will mature on June 15, 2022 (the ""Maturity Date""). Each advance bears interest at a blended rate based on the Treasury yield curve at the time such advance is borrowed. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The principal amount of the loans will be payable in equal quarterly installments commencing on September 15, 2012 through the Maturity Date. Collateral. The $5.9 billion aggregate principal amount is comprised of two loans: a $1.5 billion note secured by a first priority lien on any assets purchased or developed with the proceeds of the loans, and a $4.4 billion note secured by a junior lien on all of the collateral pledged under our Credit Agreement subordinated solely to (a) perfected security interests securing certain indebtedness, as defined in the Arrangement Agreement, and letters of credit not to exceed $19.1 billion and short-term cash management and hedging obligations in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion and (b) certain other permitted liens described in the Arrangement Agreement. Guarantees. Certain of our subsidiaries that, together with us, hold a substantial portion of the consolidated domestic automotive assets (excluding cash) and that guarantee the Credit Agreement will guarantee our obligations under the Facility, and future material domestic subsidiaries will become guarantors when formed or acquired. Affirmative Covenants. The Arrangement Agreement contains affirmative covenants substantially similar to those in the Credit Agreement (including similar baskets and exceptions), as well as certain other affirmative covenants required in connection with the ATVM Program, including compliance with ATVM Program requirements, introduction of advanced technology vehicles to meet or exceed projected overall annual fuel economy improvements and delivery of progress reports and independent auditor reports with respect to the Projects. Negative Covenants. The Arrangement Agreement contains negative covenants substantially similar to those in the Credit Agreement. The Arrangement Agreement also contains a negative covenant substantially similar to the liquidity covenant in the Credit Agreement requiring that we not permit Available Liquidity (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement) to be less than $4 billion. Events of Default. In addition to customary payment, rep
resentation, bankruptcy and judgment defaults, the Arrangement Agreement contains cross-payment and cross-acceleration defaults with respect to other debt for borrowed money and a change in control default, as well as events of default specific to the facility.

Bank Credit
Facilities Forest's
combined credit facilities consist of a $1.65 billion U.S.
credit facility (the ""U.S. Facility"") with a syndicate of banks led
by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and a $150 million Canadian
credit facility (the ""Canadian Facility,"" and together with the
U.S. Facility, the ""Credit Facilities"") with a syndicate of banks
led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch. The Credit
Facilities will mature in June 2012. Forest's
availability under the Credit Facilities is governed by a borrowing
base (the ""Global Borrowing Base""). As a result of issuing
$600 million of 81/2% senior notes
due 2014 in February 2009, Forest's borrowing base was lowered from
$1.8 billion to $1.62 billion effective February 17,
2009. As a result of the adjustment to the Global Borrowing Base,
Forest reallocated amounts under the U.S. Facility and Canadian
Facility and currently has allocated $1.47 billion to the U.S.
Facility and $150 million to the Canadian Facility. In October
2009, Forest's bank group reaffirmed Forest's $1.62 billion
Global Borrowing Base. The next redetermination of the borrowing
base is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2010. At
September 30, 2009, there were outstanding borrowings of
$318.0 million under the U.S. Facility at a weighted average
interest rate of 1.31%, and there were outstanding borrowings of
$135.4 million under the Canadian Facility at a weighted
average interest rate of 1.96%. The Company also had used the
Credit Facilities for $8.0 million in letters of credit,
leaving availability under the Credit Facilities of
$1.2 billion at September 30, 2009. Effective as of
March 16, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to its
Credit Facilities that amended certain definitions and covenants of
the credit agreements, including the total debt
outstanding-to-EBITDA ratio. 81/2% Senior Notes
Due 2014 On
February 17, 2009, Forest issued $600 million in
principal amount of 81/2% senior notes
due 2014 (the ""81/2% Notes"") at 95.15% of
par for net proceeds of $559.8 million, after deducting
initial purchaser discounts. Proceeds from the
81/2% Notes were used to pay down
outstanding balances on the Company's U.S. Facility. The
81/2% Notes are jointly and severally
guaranteed by Forest Oil Permian Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Forest, on an unsecured basis. Interest is payable on
February 15 and August 15 of each year. The
81/2% Notes will mature on
February 15, 2014. Forest may redeem up to 35% of the
81/2% Notes at any time prior to
February 15, 2012, on one or more occasions, with the proceeds
from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 108.5%
of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid
interest. Forest
may also redeem the 81/2% Notes in whole
or in part and at any time, at a ""make-whole"" redemption price
equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of
the 81/2% Notes to be redeemed or
(ii) the sum of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
and interest on the 81/2% Notes
discounted to the date of redemption at an applicable Treasury
yield rate plus 0.50%, plus, in either case, accrued but unpaid
interest.
7% Senior
Subordinated Notes Due 2013 On
June 19, 2009, Forest repurchased $1.0 million in
principal amount of 7% senior subordinated notes due 2013 at 97% of
par value.

Reorganization
In connection with the
Reorganization discussed in Note 2, on July 1, 2009 at 12:01
A.M. (the Transaction Time), IR-Limited completed the transfer of
all the outstanding shares of IR-Global to IR-International,
whereupon IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as
an issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, under the indentures
governing the Company’s outstanding notes, medium-term notes
and debentures. IR-Ireland and IR-Limited also fully and
unconditionally guarantee the payment obligations of
IR-International, IR-Global and Ingersoll-Rand Company (IR-New
Jersey), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited
incorporated in New Jersey, as the case may be, as the issuers of
debt securities under these indentures. Neither IR-Ireland nor
IR-Limited intends to issue guarantees in respect of any
indebtedness incurred by Trane. In addition, any securities issued
by the Company that were convertible, exchangeable or exercisable
into Class A common shares of IR-Limited became convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable, as the case may be, into the ordinary
shares of IR-Ireland.
On July 1, 2009,
IR-Global amended and restated its commercial paper program (the
Commercial Paper Program) pursuant to which IR-Global may issue, on
a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a
maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.25 billion.
Under the Commercial Paper Program, IR-Global may issue notes from
time to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for
general corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and
IR-International has provided an irrevocable and unconditional
guarantee for the notes issued under the Commercial Paper
Program.
Pursuant to the terms of
the credit facility entered into on August 12, 2005 and our
credit facility entered into on June 27, 2008 (the Credit
Facilities), at the Transaction Time, IR-Ireland and
IR-International became guarantors to such Credit Facilities. In
connection therewith, IR-Ireland and IR-International entered into
Addendums on July 1, 2009 to become parties to the Credit
Facilities.

Note 8. Financing Arrangements The Company has customer financing arrangements to sell its accounts receivable to a major third-party financing provider. The program does not and is not intended to affect the timing of revenue recognition because the Company only recognizes revenue upon sell-through. Under the financing arrangements, proceeds from the financing provider are due to the Company 30 days from the sale of the receivable. In these transactions with the financing provider, the Company has surrendered control over the transferred assets. The accounts receivable have been isolated from the Company and put beyond the reach of creditors, even in the event of bankruptcy. The Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through obligations or rights to redeem, transfer, or repurchase the receivables after they have been transferred. Pursuant to the receivable financing arrangements for the sale of receivables, the Company sold receivables of $122.5 million and $139.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and $294.9 million and $306.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, and 2008, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2009, and 2008, the Company received cash proceeds of $101.5 million and $125.6 million, respectively, and $277.2 million and $257.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, and 2008, respectively, from the financing provider. The amount owed by the financing provider recorded as accounts receivable on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, was $84.3 million and $73.9 million, respectively. The portion of the receivable financed that has not been recognized as revenue is accounted for as a financing arrangement. As of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, cash received from the financing provider that has not been recognized as revenue was approximately $36.7 million and $33.0 million, respectively. "

Note 5 Debt
On May 18, 2009, the Company
issued $750 million of seven-year 4.45% fixed rate U.S. Dollar
Notes, and used net proceeds of $745 million from these Notes to
retire a portion of its commercial paper. The Notes contain
customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its
restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or
enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. There is also
a change of control provision.
As of October 3, 2009 and
January 3, 2009, notes payable included commercial paper
outstanding in the amount of $433 million and $1,310 million,
respectively.
In May 2009, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $750 million,
which effectively converted its existing 5.125% U.S. Dollar
Notes due 2012 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for
the remainder of the five-year term. These derivative instruments,
which were designated as fair value hedges of the debt obligation,
resulted in an effective interest rate of 3.44% as of
October 3, 2009.
In May 2009, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $400 million,
which effectively converted a portion of its existing 6.6%
U.S. Dollar Notes due 2011 from a fixed rate to a floating
rate obligation for the remainder of the 10-year term. These
derivative instruments, which were designated as fair value hedges
of the debt obligation, resulted in an effective interest rate of
5.79% as of October 3, 2009 on the portion of the debt related
to the interest rate swaps.
For all interest rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt, the
corresponding change in the fair value of hedged debt, reflected as
an increase in long-term debt on the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet, amounted to $47 million and $43 million at
October 3, 2009 and January 3, 2009,
respectively.
Subsequent
event
On October 28, 2009 the Company
announced the launch of a cash tender offer for up to $500 million
aggregate principal amount of its 6.6% Notes due 2011, conditioned
on the receipt of net proceeds from a public offering of unsecured
senior debt securities.

750,789 We have a $600 million unsecured bank credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), which was originally scheduled to mature on March 15, 2012. During the first quarter of 2008, the term of the Credit Facility was extended for an additional one-year period to March 15, 2013. During this one-year extension period, the total amount available under the Credit Facility will be $575 million, but we have the right to seek an increase of the total amount available during that period to $600 million. We may, subject to certain conditions, request that the term of the Credit Facility be further extended for an additional one-year period. Our subsidiary, Noble Drilling Corporation (“Noble Drilling”), has guaranteed the obligations under the Credit Facility. In connection with our recently completed worldwide internal restructuring (see Note 13), our subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited, issued a subsidiary guarantee under the Credit Facility effective October 1, 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect to increase the amount available up to $800 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest (i) at the sum of Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Facility; 0.235 percent based on our current credit ratings), or (ii) at the base rate, determined as the greater of the prime rate for U.S. Dollar loans announced by Citibank, N.A. in New York or the sum of the weighted average overnight federal funds rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50 percent. The Credit Facility contains various covenants, including a debt to total tangible capitalization covenant that limits this ratio to 0.60. As of September 30, 2009, our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization was 0.10. In addition, the Credit Facility includes restrictions on certain fundamental changes such as mergers, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the Credit Facility, and the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets unless to a subsidiary. The Credit Facility also limits our subsidiaries’ additional indebtedness, excluding intercompany advances and loans, to 10 percent of our consolidated net assets, as defined in the Credit Facility, unless a subsidiary guarantee is issued to the parent company borrower. There are also restrictions on our incurring or assuming additional liens in certain circumstances. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility at September 30, 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, we repaid $150 million principal amount of 6.95% Senior Notes due 2009 and $23 million principal amount of project financing Thompson Notes using cash on hand at maturity. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value represents the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The estimated fair value of our senior notes was based on the quoted market prices for similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar remaining maturities. The following table presents the estimated fair value of our long-term debt as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

870 Senior Notes In connection with the merger of Grant Prideco, the Company completed an exchange offer relative to the $175 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2015 previously issued by Grant Prideco. On April 21, 2008, $151 million of Grant Prideco Senior Notes were exchanged for National Oilwell Varco Senior Notes. The National Oilwell Varco Senior Notes have the same interest rate, interest payment dates, redemption terms and maturity as the Grant Prideco Senior Notes. In November 2008, the Company repurchased $23 million of the unexchanged Grant Prideco Senior Notes. Revolving Credit Facilities On April 21, 2008, the Company replaced its existing $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate of $3 billion of unsecured credit facilities and borrowed $2 billion to finance the cash portion of the Grant Prideco acquisition. These facilities consisted of a $2 billion, five-year revolving credit facility and a $1 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2009, there were no borrowings against these facilities, and there were $589 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under these facilities, resulting in $1,411 million of funds available under this revolving credit facility. Interest under this multicurrency facility is based upon LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR plus 0.26% subject to a ratings-based grid, or the prime rate. In early February 2009, we terminated early the $1 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility, which matured April 20, 2009. The Company also had $2,234 million of additional outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2009, primarily in Norway, that are essentially under various bilateral committed letter of credit facilities. Other letters of credit are issued as bid bonds and performance bonds. The Senior Notes contain reporting covenants and the credit facility contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt to capitalization. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2009. Other Other debt includes approximately $4 million in promissory notes due to former owners of businesses acquired who remain employed by the Company. "

1,2009-11-06,890801,XBRL," 8. Credit Facilities On December 22, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions (“the Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a $100.0 million unsecured term loan and a $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a $25.0 million letter of credit sublimit. The Credit Facility also contains an expansion option permitting us to arrange up to an aggregate of $200.0 million in additional commitments from existing lenders and/or new lenders at the lenders’ discretion. Loans may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros or other currencies agreed to by the lenders. Loans will bear interest at our election at the prime rate or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin (ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%) that varies with our consolidated leverage ratio (a “eurocurrency loan”). Our interest rate was 2.3% as of September 30, 2009. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to prime rate loans and at the end of an interest period (or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months) in the case of eurocurrency loans. Commitment fees range from 0.25% to 0.45% of the unused portion on the credit facility depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. In January 2009, we borrowed $100.0 million against the term loan in the Credit Facility. The principal together with any accrued interest on the term loan is due on December 22, 2009. No balances were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008. The Credit Facility, which is subject to certain quarterly financial covenants, terminates on December 22, 2011, on which date all outstanding principal of, together with accrued interest on, any revolving loans will be due. We may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs in the case of eurocurrency loans. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Facility. In addition, we have a 14 million Euro credit facility with a bank (“the Euro Credit Facility”). The Euro Credit Facility is available on an offering basis, meaning that transactions under the Euro Credit Facility will be on such terms and conditions, including interest rate, maturity, representations, covenants and events of default, as mutually agreed between us and the bank at the time of each specific transaction. The Euro Credit Facility is intended to be used for short-term credit requirements, with terms of one year or less. The Euro Credit Facility can be canceled at any time. No balances were outstanding under the Euro Credit Facility as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. "

750,789 We have a $600 million unsecured bank credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), which was originally scheduled to mature on March 15, 2012. During the first quarter of 2008, the term of the Credit Facility was extended for an additional one-year period to March 15, 2013. During this one-year extension period, the total amount available under the Credit Facility will be $575 million, but we have the right to seek an increase of the total amount available during that period to $600 million. We may, subject to certain conditions, request that the term of the Credit Facility be further extended for an additional one-year period. Our subsidiary, Noble Drilling Corporation (“Noble Drilling”), has guaranteed the obligations under the Credit Facility. In connection with our recently completed worldwide internal restructuring (see Note 13), our subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited, issued a subsidiary guarantee under the Credit Facility effective October 1, 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect to increase the amount available up to $800 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest (i) at the sum of Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Facility; 0.235 percent based on our current credit ratings), or (ii) at the base rate, determined as the greater of the prime rate for U.S. Dollar loans announced by Citibank, N.A. in New York or the sum of the weighted average overnight federal funds rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50 percent. The Credit Facility contains various covenants, including a debt to total tangible capitalization covenant that limits this ratio to 0.60. As of September 30, 2009, our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization was 0.10. In addition, the Credit Facility includes restrictions on certain fundamental changes such as mergers, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the Credit Facility, and the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets unless to a subsidiary. The Credit Facility also limits our subsidiaries’ additional indebtedness, excluding intercompany advances and loans, to 10 percent of our consolidated net assets, as defined in the Credit Facility, unless a subsidiary guarantee is issued to the parent company borrower. There are also restrictions on our incurring or assuming additional liens in certain circumstances. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility at September 30, 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, we repaid $150 million principal amount of 6.95% Senior Notes due 2009 and $23 million principal amount of project financing Thompson Notes using cash on hand at maturity. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value represents the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The estimated fair value of our senior notes was based on the quoted market prices for similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar remaining maturities. The following table presents the estimated fair value of our long-term debt as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted an accounting standard which clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, are not considered debt instruments. The standard also specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when recognizing interest cost in subsequent periods. The following table illustrates the effect on the Company’s interest expense amount in the statement of operations: Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 (Dollars in millions) As previously stated $54.1 $171.0 Increase due to application of new standard 0.3 0.6 As adjusted $54.4 $171.6 For the periods presented, there was no change to the Company’s EPS figures related to the retrospective application of the allocation of the Company’s convertible debt between debt and equity components and the related impact on interest expense. The following table illustrates the carrying amount of the equity and debt components of the Company’s Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures) as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008: September 30, December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Carrying amount of the equity component $215.4 $215.4 Principal amount of the liability component $732.5 $732.5 Unamortized discount (361.4) (362.6) Net carrying amount $371.1 $369.9 The following tables illustrate the effective interest rate and the interest expense related to the Debentures: Three Months Ended

These borrowings are designated as working capital borrowings, must be repaid within one year and are primarily for hedged LPG and crude oil inventory and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) margin deposits. (2) Our fixed rate senior notes have a face value of approximately $4.4 billion as of September 30, 2009. We estimate the aggregate fair value of these notes as of September 30, 2009 to be approximately $4.7 billion. Our fixed-rate senior notes are traded among institutions, which trades are routinely published by a reporting service. Our determination of fair value is based on reported trading activity near quarter end. (3) On September 4, 2009, we gave irrevocable notice to redeem all of our outstanding $250 million 7.13% senior notes due 2014. After the 30-day notice period, the notes were redeemed on October 5, 2009. Therefore, these notes (including the unamortized premium) are classified as short-term debt on our balance sheet. In conjuction with the early redemption, we will recognize a loss of approximately $4 million. (4) We repaid our $175 million 4.75% senior notes on August 15, 2009. (5) These notes were issued in July 2009 and the proceeds are being used to supplement capital available from our hedged inventory facility. At September 30, 2009, approximately $437 million had been used to fund hedged inventory and would be classified as short-term debt if funded on our credit facilities. Senior Notes In September 2009, we completed the issuance of $500
million of 5.75% senior notes due January 15, 2020. The
senior notes were sold at 99.523% of face value. Interest
payments are due on January 15 and July 15 of each year,
beginning on January 15, 2010. We used the net proceeds
from this offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit
facilities, a portion of which was used to fund the cash
requirements of the PNGS Acquisition (which included repayment of
all of PNGSs debt). See Note 4 for further discussion of the
PNGS Acquisition. In July 2009, we completed the issuance of $500
million of 4.25% senior notes due September 1, 2012. The
senior notes were sold at 99.802% of face value. Interest
payments are due on March 1 and September 1 of each year,
beginning on March 1, 2010. We used the net proceeds
from this offering to supplement the capital available under our
existing hedged inventory facility to fund working capital needs
associated with base levels of routine foreign crude oil import and
for seasonal LPG inventory requirements. Concurrent with the
issuance of these senior notes, we entered into interest rate swaps
whereby we receive fixed payments at 4.25% and pay three-month
LIBOR plus a spread on a notional principal amount of $150 million
maturing in two years and an additional $150 million notional
principal amount maturing in three years. In April 2009, we completed the issuance of $350
million of 8.75% senior notes due May 1, 2019. The
senior notes were sold at 99.994% of face value. Interest
payments are due on May 1 and November 1 of each year,
beginning on November 1, 2009. We used the net proceeds
from this offering to reduce outstanding borrowings under our
credit facilities. Credit Facilities In October 2009, we renewed our 364-day committed hedged
inventory credit facility, which matures in October 2010. The
new committed facility replaced a similar $525 million facility
that was scheduled to mature on November 5, 2009. The new
facility has a borrowing capacity of $500 million, which may
be increased to $1.2 billion, subject to obtaining additional
lender commitments. Borrowings under this facility will be used to
finance the purchase of hedged crude oil inventory for storage
activities as well as for foreign import activities. Letters of Credit In connection with our crude oil marketing, we provide
certain suppliers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to
secure our obligation for the purchase of crude oil. At
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had
outstanding letters of credit of approximately $66 million and $51
million, respectively.

On
June 30, 2009, Torchmark issued $300 million principal amount
of 9.25% Senior Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on the Notes
is payable semi-annually commencing on December 15, 2009.
Proceeds from the issuance of this debt, net of expenses, were $296
million. The Notes are redeemable by Torchmark in whole or in part
at any time subject to a “make-whole” premium, whereby
the Company would be required to pay the greater of the full
principal amount of the Notes or otherwise the present value of the
remaining repayment schedule of the Notes discounted at a rate of
interest equivalent to the rate of a United States Treasury

repaid $150 million of its first and refunding mortgage bonds.
In March 2009, SCE purchased two issues of its tax-exempt pollution
control bonds totaling $219 million and converted the issues
to a variable rate structure. SCE continues to hold the bonds which
remain outstanding and have not been retired or
cancelled.
Credit
Agreements
On March 17,
2009, SCE entered into a new $500 million 364-day revolving
credit facility, terminating on March 16, 2010. The additional
liquidity provided by the facility will be used to support SCE's
ongoing power procurement-related needs.
In June 2009, SCE
amended its $2.5 billion five-year credit facility to remove a
subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings as a lender which resulted
in a reduction of the total commitment under the facility to
$2.4 billion.

7,797 We are
authorized to borrow up to $10.0 billion under the U.S. commercial
paper program we maintain. We had $1.231 billion outstanding under
this program as of September 30, 2009, with an average
interest rate of 0.12%. As of September 30, 2009, we have
classified the entire commercial paper balance as a current
liability in our consolidated balance sheet. As of
December 31, 2008, $1.0 billion of commercial paper was
classified as long-term debt in anticipation of the subsequent
issuance of fixed rate notes, as discussed further below. We also
maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are
authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a variety of
currencies, however there were no amounts outstanding under this
program as of September 30, 2009. We maintain two
credit agreements with a consortium of banks. One of these
agreements provides revolving credit facilities of $3.0 billion,
and expires on April 15, 2010. Interest on any amounts we
borrow under this facility would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus a
percentage determined by quotations from Markit Group Ltd. for our
1-year credit default swap spread, subject to certain minimum rates
and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. If our public
debt ratings are A / A2 or above, the minimum applicable margin is
1.00% and the maximum applicable margin is 2.00%; if our public
debt ratings are lower than A / A2, the minimum applicable margin
is 1.50% and the maximum applicable margin is 3.00%. The second
agreement provides revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion, and
expires on April 19, 2012. Interest on any amounts we borrow
under this facility would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis
points. At September 30, 2009, there were no outstanding
borrowings under either of these facilities. In addition to
these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective
registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is
available for registered offerings of short or long-term debt
securities. In March 2009,
we completed an offering of $1.0 billion of 3.875% senior notes due
April 2014 and $1.0 billion of 5.125% senior notes due April 2019.
These notes pay interest semiannually, and we may redeem the notes
at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a
“make-whole” amount, plus accrued interest. After
pricing and underwriting discounts, we received a total of $1.989
billion in cash proceeds from the offering. The proceeds from the
offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the
reduction of our outstanding commercial paper balance. In October
2009, $62 million in facility notes and bonds matured, and an
additional $46 million that were originally scheduled to mature in
2018 were called for early redemption. Our existing
debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross-default or
ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit
facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. As of
September 30, 2009 and for all prior periods, we have
satisfied these financial covenants. These covenants limit the
amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur, and limit the
amount of attributable debt in sale-leaseback transactions, to 10%
of net tangible assets. As of September 30, 2009, 10% of net
tangible assets is equivalent to $2.281 billion, however we have no
covered sale-leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness
outstanding. Additionally, we are required to maintain a minimum
net worth, as defined, of $5.0 billion on a quarterly basis. As of
September 30, 2009, our net worth, as defined, was equivalent
to $12.512 billion. We do not expect these covenants to have a
material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

all borrowings under the facility for a period of two days during
the second quarter of each year. The issuance of
commercial paper, letters of credit and other borrowings reduces
the amounts available under the credit facilities. Our credit
agreements contain various financial and other covenants, including
the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Failure to meet those
covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in
accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of
September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with those
covenants. In addition, our credit agreements allow for
acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to
nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of other
significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its
subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain
material adverse change clauses.

DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES Material changes, if any, to Progress Energy’s, PEC’s and PEF’s debt and credit facilities and financing activities since December 31, 2008, are as follows: On January 15, 2009, PEC issued $600 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 5.30% Series due 2019. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the maturity of PEC’s $400 million 5.95% Senior Notes, due March 1, 2009. The remaining proceeds were used to repay PEC’s outstanding short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. On February 3, 2009, the Parent repaid $100 million of the $600 million outstanding balance at December 31, 2008, borrowed under its RCA with proceeds from its 14.4 million share common stock issuance discussed in Note 6D. During the third quarter of 2009, the Parent further reduced the outstanding RCA balance by $300 million with cash on hand, resulting in an outstanding balance of $200 million at September 30, 2009. Subsequent to September 30, 2009, the Parent repaid an additional $100 million of the outstanding balance with proceeds from commercial paper borrowings. At November 6, 2009, the outstanding balance of the RCA loan was $100 million. We will continue to monitor the commercial paper and short-term credit markets to determine when to repay the remaining outstanding balance of the RCA loan, while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. On March 19, 2009, the Parent issued an aggregate $750 million of Senior Notes consisting of $300 million of 6.05% Senior Notes due 2014 and $450 million of 7.05% Senior Notes due 2019. A portion of the proceeds was used to fund PEF’s capita
l expenditures through an equity contribution with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes. On June 18, 2009, PEC entered into a Seventy-seventh Supplemental Indenture to its Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated May 1, 1940, as supplemented, in connection with certain amendments to the mortgage. The amendments are set forth in the Seventy-seventh Supplemental Indenture and include an amendment to extend the maturity date of the mortgage by 100 years. The maturity date of the mortgage is now May 1, 2140. "

LONG-TERM DEBT Commercial
Paper Prudential
Financial has a commercial paper program rated A-1 by
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
(“S&P”), P-2 by Moody’s Investor Service,
Inc. (“Moody’s”) and F2 by Fitch Ratings Ltd.
(“Fitch”) as of September 30, 2009. Prudential
Financial’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $209
million and $1,243 million as of September 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. Prudential
Funding, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance,
has a commercial paper program, rated A-1+ by S&P, P-2 by
Moody’s and F1 by Fitch as of September 30, 2009.
Prudential Funding’s outstanding commercial paper and master
note borrowings were $716 million and $4,354 million as of
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
Prudential Financial has issued a subordinated guarantee covering
Prudential Funding’s domestic commercial paper
program. As of
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the weighted
average maturity of the total commercial paper outstanding was 49
and 29 days, respectively. Both Prudential
Financial’s and Prudential Funding’s commercial paper
programs were granted approval during the fourth quarter of 2008 to
participate in the Commercial Paper Funding Facility
(“CPFF”) sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York. Commercial paper programs must maintain ratings of at least
A-1/P-1/F1 by at least two rating agencies in order to be eligible
for the CPFF. As of September 30, 2009, neither Prudential
Financial nor Prudential Funding had any commercial paper
outstanding under the CPFF. On February 19, 2009, the
commercial paper credit rating of Prudential Financial was
downgraded by Fitch from F1 to F2. Consequently, as of that date,
Prudential Financial became ineligible to issue commercial paper
under the CPFF. Prudential Funding continues to be eligible based
on its current credit ratings to sell to the CPFF three-month
unsecured U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper up to a maximum
of $9.815 billion, less the outstanding amount of any non-CPFF
commercial paper at any applicable time. Access to the CPFF for the
issuance of new commercial paper is scheduled to terminate on
February 1, 2010, unless such date is extended by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. Convertible Senior
Notes On
December 12, 2007, Prudential Financial issued in a private
placement $3.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes
that are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into
cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock. The
conversion price, $132.39 per share, is subject to adjustment upon
certain corporate events. The conversion feature requires net
settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, a holder would
receive cash up to the par amount of the convertible notes
surrendered for conversion and shares of Prudential Financial
Common Stock only for the portion of the settlement amount in
excess of the par amount, if any. These notes are redeemable by
Prudential Financial, at par plus accrued interest, on or after
June 16, 2009. Holders of the notes may also require
Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued
interest, on contractually specified dates, of which the first such
date was June 15, 2009. On June 15, 2009, $1,819 million
of these notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial as required
by the holders. The next date on which holders of these notes may
require Prudential Financial to repurchase these notes is
December 15, 2009. Separately, during the fourth quarter of
2008 and the first nine months of 2009, the Company repurchased, in
individually negotiated transactions, $853 million and $297
million, respectively, of these notes which were offered to the
Company by certain holders. The notes repurchased in 2009 at a
discount resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7 million that is recorded
within “Asset management fees and other income.” As of
September 30, 2009, $31 million of these floating rate
convertible senior notes remain outstanding. In addition, as of
September 30, 2009, $4 million of floating rate convertible
senior notes that were issued by Prudential Financial in a private
placement in December 2006 remain outstanding. The next date on
which holders of these notes may require Prudential Financial to
repurchase these notes is December 12, 2009. Medium-term
Notes In June 2009,
Prudential Financial issued $250 million of 6.20% medium-term notes
due January 2015 and $750 million of 7.375% medium-term notes due
June 2019 under its shelf registration statement. In September
2009, Prudential Financial issued $600 million of 3.625%
medium-term notes due September 2012 and $900 million of 4.75%
medium-term notes due September 2015 under its shelf registration
statement. Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York Prudential
Insurance has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New
York (“FHLBNY”) since June 2008. Membership allows
Prudential Insurance access to collateralized advances,
collateralized funding agreements, and other FHLBNY products.
Collateralized advances from the FHLBNY are classified in
“Short-term debt” or “Long-term debt,”
depending on the maturity date of the obligation. Collateralized
funding agreements issued to the FHLBNY are classified in
“Policyholders’ account balances.” These funding
agreements have priority claim status above debt holders of
Prudential Insurance. Prudential
Insurance’s membership in FHLBNY requires the ownership of
member stock, and borrowings from FHLBNY require the purchase of
FHLBNY activity based stock in an amount equal to 4.5% of the
outstanding borrowings. All FHLBNY stock purchased by Prudential
Insurance is classified as restricted general account investments
within “Other long-term investments,” and the carrying
value of these investments was $221 million as of
September 30, 2009. The FHLBNY
requires Prudential Insurance to pledge qualifying mortgage-related
assets or U.S. Treasury securities as collateral for all
borrowings. On May 8, 2009, the New Jersey Department of
Banking and Insurance (“NJDOBI”) revised its prior
guidance to increase the maximum amount of qualifying assets that
Prudential Insurance may pledge as collateral to the FHLBNY from 5%
to 7% of its prior year-end statutory net admitted assets exclusive
of separate account assets; however, this limitation resets to 5%
on December 31, 2010 unless extended by NJDOBI. Based on its
statutory net admitted assets as of December 31, 2008, the 7%
limitation equates to a maximum amount of pledged assets of $10.5
billion and an estimated maximum borrowing capacity, after taking
into account applicable required collateralization levels and
required purchases of activity based FHLBNY stock, of approximately
$9.0 billion. However, the ability to borrow from the FHLBNY is
subject to the availability and maintenance of qualifying assets at
Prudential Insurance, and there is no assurance that Prudential
Insurance will have sufficient qualifying assets available to it in
order to access the increased capacity in full at any particular
time. Also, the revised guidance from NJDOBI limits the aggregate
amount of assets Prudential Insurance may pledge for all loans,
including borrowings from the FHLBNY, to 10% of its prior year-end
statutory net admitted assets exclusive of separate account assets;
however, this limitation excludes certain activities, such as
asset-based financing transactions. The fair value
of the qualifying assets pledged as collateral by Prudential
Insurance must be maintained at certain specified levels of the
borrowed amount, which can vary, depending on the nature of the
assets pledged. As of September 30, 2009, Prudential Insurance
had pledged qualifying assets with a fair value of $7,530 million,
which is above the minimum level required by the FHLBNY, and had
total outstanding borrowings of $3.5 billion. The total borrowings
from the FHLBNY as of September 30, 2009, is comprised of
collateralized advances, of which $1.0 billion is reflected in
“Short-term debt” and $1.0 billion is reflected in
“Long-term debt,” as well as $1.5 billion of
collateralized funding agreements that are reflected in
“Policyholders’ account balances.” Exchangeable Surplus
Notes In
September 2009, Prudential Insurance issued in a private
placement $500 million of surplus notes due September 2019 with an
interest rate of 5.36% per annum. The surplus notes are
exchangeable at the option of the holder, in whole but not in part,
for shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock beginning in
September 2014, or earlier upon a fundamental business combination
involving Prudential Financial or a continuing payment default. The
initial exchange rate for the surplus notes is 10.1235 shares of
Common Stock per each $1,000 principal amount of surplus notes,
which represents an initial exchange price per share of Common
Stock of $98.78; however, the exchange rate is subject to customary
anti-dilution adjustments. The exchange rate is also subject to a
make-whole decrease in the event of an exchange prior to maturity
(except upon a fundamental business combination or a continuing
payment default), that will result in a reduction in the number of
shares issued upon exchange (per $1,000 principal amount of surplus
notes) determined by dividing a prescribed cash reduction value
(which will decline over the life of the surplus notes, from
$102.62 for an exercise on September 18, 2014 to zero for an
exercise at maturity) by the price of the Common Stock at the time
of exchange. In addition, the exchange rate is subject to a
customary make-whole increase in connection with an exchange of the
surplus notes upon a fundamental business combination where 10% or
more of the consideration in that business combination consists of
cash, other property or securities that are not listed on a U.S.
national securities exchange. The surplus
notes are not redeemable by Prudential Insurance prior to maturity,
except in connection with a fundamental business combination
involving Prudential Financial, in which case the surplus notes
will be redeemable by Prudential Insurance, subject to the
noteholders’ right to exchange the surplus notes instead, at
par or, if greater, a make-whole redemption price. The surplus
notes are subordinated to all other Prudential Insurance borrowings
and policyholder obligations, except for other surplus notes of
Prudential Insurance (including those currently outstanding), with
which the surplus notes rank pari passu. Payments of
interest and principal on the surplus notes may only be made with
the prior approval of the New Jersey Department of Banking and
Insurance. TALF
Borrowings During the
first nine months of 2009, the Company purchased securities under
the Federal Reserve’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan
Facility (“TALF”). TALF provides secured financing for
asset-backed securities backed by certain types of consumer and
small business loans and as of July 2009 for certain high-quality
commercial mortgage-backed securities issued before January 1,
2009. TALF financing is non-recourse to the borrower, is
collateralized by the purchased securities and provides financing
for the purchase price of the securities, less a
‘haircut’ that varies based on the type of collateral.
Borrowers under the program can deliver the collateralized
securities to a special purpose vehicle created by the Federal
Reserve in full defeasance of the loan. During the
first nine months of 2009, the Company obtained $1,167 million of
secured financing from the Federal Reserve under this program. In
September 2009, the Company sold a portion of the securities
purchased under the program and used the proceeds to repay $188
million of the borrowings. As of September 30, 2009, the
Company had $1,066 million of securities purchased under TALF that
are reflected within “Other trading account assets,”
and had $979 million of secured financing from the Federal Reserve
related to the purchase of these securities that is reflected
within “Long-term debt.” The Company is carrying the
securities and the loan at fair value.

Note 9. Junior
Subordinated Convertible Debentures In 2007, the
Company issued $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.25% convertible
debentures due August 15, 2037, to an initial purchaser in a
private offering. The Convertible Debentures are subordinated in
right of payment to the Company’s existing and future senior
debt and to the other liabilities of the Company’s
subsidiaries. The Convertible Debentures are initially convertible,
subject to certain conditions, into shares of the Company’s
common stock at a conversion rate of 29.0968 shares of common stock
per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Debentures, representing
an initial effective conversion price of approximately $34.37 per
share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to
adjustment for certain events as outlined in the Indenture
governing the Convertible Debentures but will not be adjusted for
accrued interest. As of September 30, 2009, the if-converted
value of the Convertible Debentures does not exceed its principal
amount. Effective
January 1, 2009, the Company retroactively adopted FSP APB
14-1, codified in ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other
Options. The standard specifies that issuers of convertible
debt instruments should separately account for the liability (debt)
and equity (conversion option) components of such instruments in a
manner that reflects the borrowing rate for a similar
non-convertible debt. The Company
calculated the carrying value of the liability component at
issuance as the present value of its cash flows using a discount
rate of 8.5% (borrowing rate for similar non-convertible debt with
no contingent payment options), adjusted for the fair value of the
contingent interest feature, yielding an effective interest rate of
8.39%. The carrying value of the liability component was determined
to be $550.5 million. The excess of the principal amount of the
debt over the carrying value of the liability component is also
called “debt discount” or “equity
component” of the Convertible Debentures. The equity
component of the Convertible Debentures on the date of issuance was
$700.7 million. The debt discount will be amortized using the
Company’s effective interest rate of 8.39% over the term of
the Convertible Debentures as a non-cash charge to interest expense
included in Other loss, net. As of September 30, 2009, the
remaining term of the Convertible Debentures is 27.9
years. The table below
presents the carrying amounts of the liability and equity
components: September 30,

features related to the contingent interest payments,
over-allotment option, and the Company making specific types of
distributions (e.g., extraordinary dividends) qualify as
derivatives to be accounted for separately. The fair value of the
derivatives at the date of issuance of the Convertible Debentures
was $11.4 million including $7.8 million for the contingent
interest payment features and $3.6 million for the over-allotment
option feature, which is accounted for as a discount on the
Convertible Debentures. The over-allotment feature was revalued at
$12.6 million on the date of exercise at August 28, 2007,
which is currently accounted for as a premium on the Convertible
Debentures. The debt discount and the debt premium are being
accreted to the face value of the Convertible Debentures as net
interest expense over 30 years. The balances of the debt discount
and debt premium are included in the carrying amount of the
liability component.

1,2009-11-06,1011006,XBRL," Note 9 DEBT In April 2003,
the Company issued $750 million of the Notes due April 1,
2008, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately
$733 million after transaction fees of $17 million, which
had been deferred and subsequently amortized. The Notes were issued
at par, did not bear interest, and were convertible into shares of
the Company’s common stock. Upon conversion, the Company had
the right to deliver cash in lieu of common stock. During the
three months ended March 31, 2008, $167 million of the
Notes were converted and 8.1 million shares of Yahoo! common
stock were issued to the holders of the Notes. On the maturity date
of April 1, 2008, the remaining $583 million of the Notes were
converted and 28.5 million shares of Yahoo! common stock were
issued to the holders of the Notes. Effective
January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 470-20, “Debt
with Conversion and Other Options,” and accordingly prior
periods have been restated. For convertible debt instruments within
the scope of ASC 470-20, the proceeds from the instrument’s
issuance must be allocated between the liability and equity
components in a manner that reflects interest cost based upon the
Company’s borrowing rate at the date of issuance of the
convertible debt for a similar debt instrument without the debt
conversion feature. The borrowing rate was estimated to be 5
percent for the liability component of the Notes. This effective
interest rate was used to calculate the fair value of the Notes
using a present value approach and the accretion of interest
expense over the life of the Notes. Upon adoption
of ASC 470-20, the Company recorded the change in accounting
principle as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 totaling $69
million which represented imputed interest, net of taxes, for the
period from issuance to January 1, 2007. The corresponding
increase in additional paid-in capital as of January 1, 2007
was $95 million. Imputed interest, which is net of $66 million in
taxes, recorded over the life of the Notes resulted in a reduction
in retained earnings of $95 million and a corresponding increase in
additional paid-in capital of $95 million as of the maturity
date. Imputed
interest expense was immaterial for the three months ended
September 30, 2008 and $9.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2008 and is included in other income, net on the
condensed consolidated statements of income. There was no impact on
basic net income per share for the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2008. See Note 2 —
“Basic and Diluted Net Income per Share Attributable to
Yahoo! Inc. Common Stockholders” for additional
information.

438.3 On July 6,
2009, the Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority
issued $235 million of 7.0% tax-exempt bonds that mature in 2039
and loaned the proceeds therefrom to AE Supply to finance a portion
of the cost of constructing and installing Scrubbers at AE
Supply’s Hatfield’s Ferry generation facility. AE
Supply capitalized $2.4 million in debt issuance costs associated
with this transaction. On
September 4, 2009, AE Supply repurchased $97.5 million and
$146.8 million, respectively, of its 7.80% Notes due 2011 and its
8.25% Notes due 2012 pursuant to a cash tender offer, at an
aggregate premium of $18.1 million. AE Supply expensed the $18.1
million premium, $0.6 million in unamortized debt costs, and $0.6
million in fees associated with the tender offer during the three
months ended September 30, 2009. On
September 24, 2009, AE Supply entered into a new $1 billion
senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a three-year
maturity. The new revolving credit facility replaces AE
Supply’s previous $400 million revolving credit facility,
which was scheduled to mature in May 2011. Loans under the new
facility generally will bear interest that is calculated based on
the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin based on AE
Supply’s senior unsecured credit rating. AE Supply
capitalized $22.1 million in debt costs related to this
facility. On
October 1, 2009, AE Supply issued $600 million aggregate
principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $350
million of 5.75% Notes due 2019 and $250 million of 6.75% Notes due
2039. AE Supply used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of
these notes to repay in full its existing $447 million term loan on
October 2, 2009. AE Supply capitalized $5.3 million in debt
issuance costs associated with this new debt issuance and expensed
$0.6 million of unamortized debt costs associated with the
extinguished term loan. On
October 21, 2009, AE Supply used the remaining proceeds of its
senior secured note offering to repurchase approximately $152
million aggregate principal amount of its 7.80% Medium Term Notes
due 2011 pursuant to a cash tender offer at an aggregate premium of
$12.7 million. AE Supply plans to expense the $12.7 million
premium, $0.3 million in unamortized debt costs, and $0.4 million
in fees related to this tender offer during the three months ending
December 31, 2009.

11. Credit Facilities, Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt Short-term borrowings are summarized as follows (in thousands of dollars): September 30 December 31 September 30 2009 2008 2008 Bank borrowings $0 $1,082,500 $1,163,500 Commercial paper 286,357 0 0 Total short-term borrowings $286,357 $1,082,500 $1,163,500 Bank borrowings Maturity n/a 2 days 1 day Weighted-average interest rate n/a 1.63% 2.73% Commercial paper Maturity 1 to 63 days n/a n/a Weighted-average interest rate 0.42% n/a n/a We utilize our bank lines of credit as liquidity back-up for outstanding commercial paper or draw on the bank lines to access LIBOR-based short-term loans to fund our borrowing requirements. Periodically, we issue commercial paper for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements. We plan to continue this practice from time to time as circumstances warrant. Our policy is to maintain committed credit facilities at least equal to our outstanding commercial paper. Unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $1,675,000,000 were maintained at September 30, 2009. Our $1,500,000,000 bank credit facility expires November 16, 2012. Effective October 1, 2009, we canceled our $175,000,000 bank credit facility prior to its scheduled expiration date of November 16, 2009. As of September 30, 2009, none of the lines of credit was drawn. Interest rates referable to borrowings under these lines of credit are determined at the time of borrowing based on current market conditions. All lines of credit extended to us in 2009 and 2008 were based solely on a commitment fee; no compensating balances were required. In the normal course of business, we maintain balances for which we are credited with earnings allowances. To the extent the earnings allowances are not sufficient to fully compensate banks for the services they provide, we pay the fee equivalent for the differences. As of September 30, 2009, $3,669,000 of our long-term debt, including current maturities, was secured. This secured debt was assumed with the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock. All other debt obligations, both short-term borrowings and long-term debt, are unsecured. In February 2009, we issued $400,000,000 of long-term notes in two related series (tranches), as follows: $150,000,000 of 10.125% coupon notes due December 2015 and $250,000,000 of 10.375% coupon notes due December 2018. These notes were issued principally to repay borrowings outstanding under our short- and long-term debt obligations. The notes were initially sold to Goldman Sachs pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), as amended, and subsequently resold to Berkshire Hathaway pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. In May 2009, these notes were exchanged for substantially identical notes that were registered under the Securities Act. The notes are presented in the table below net of unamortized discounts from par. Discounts and debt issuance costs are being amortized using the effective interest method over the respective lives of the notes.&lt

The estimated fair values of long-term debt presented in the table above were determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on credit-adjusted interest rates on U.S. Treasury bills, notes or bonds, as appropriate. The fair value estimates were based on information available to management as of the respective balance sheet dates. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since those dates. Our debt agreements do not subject us to contractual restrictions with regard to working capital or the amount we may expend for cash dividends and purchases of our stock. The percentage of consolidated debt to total capitalization (total debt as a percentage of total capital), as defined in our bank credit facility agreements, must be less than 65%. Our total debt as a percentage of total capital was 41.1% as of September 30, 2009; 50.0% as of December 31, 2008; and 48.1% as of September 30, 2008."

On July 31, 2009, the Company entered into an indenture in connection with the issuance of the 8.75% senior notes as discussed in Note 4, “Equity and Debt Offerings.” Interest is payable on the notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing February 1, 2010. At any time on or after August 1, 2013, the Company may redeem some or all of the notes. The redemption price, reflected as a percentage of the principal amount, is: 104.375% for notes redeemed between August 1, 2013 and July 31, 2014; 102.188% for notes redeemed between August 1, 2014 and July 31, 2015; and 100% for notes redeemed on or after August 1, 2015.&lt
;/font>
The notes are guaranteed by most of the Company’s subsidiaries, except for Arch Western and its subsidiaries and Arch Receivable Company, LLC. If the Company fails to meet a coverage ratio test as defined in the indenture, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt; pay dividends and make distributions or repurchase stock; make investments; create liens; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; enter into restrictions affecting the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make distributions, loans or advances to the Company; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leasebacks; and merge or consolidate or transfer and sell assets would be limited.
The Company and the guarantor subsidiaries entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) in connection with the senior notes. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to exchange a like aggregate principal amount of senior notes identical in all material respects to the 8.75% senior notes. Pursuant to the Registration Rights agreement, the Company must make reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective by July 31, 2010 and complete the exchange by September 14, 2010. Should those events not occur within the specified time frame, the interest rate shall be increased by one-quarter or one percent per annum for the first 90 days following such period. Such interest rate will increase by an additional one-quarter of one percent per annum thereafter up to a maximum aggregate increase of one percent per annum. Once any of the required events occur, the interest rate will revert to the rate specified in the indenture.
Amendments to Credit Facilities
On August 27, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Credit Amendment”) to its $800.0 million secured revolving credit facility. The Credit Amendment extended the maturity of the credit facility from June 23, 2011 to March 31, 2013 and increased the Company’s borrowing capacity from $800.0 million to $860.0 million until June 23, 2011, when it will then decrease to $762.5 million. New banks may join the credit facility after June 23, 2011, subject to an aggregate maximum borrowing amount of $800.0 million. The Credit Amendment also increased the maximum leverage ratio, as defined, that the Company mus
t maintain. On March 6, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Credit Amendment”) to its $800.0 million secured revolving credit facility. The Credit Amendment amended certain covenants to make them less restrictive, including those related to lien creation, restricted payments and subsidiary guarantees of debt, in addition to an increase in the maximum leverage ratio, as defined, that the Company must maintain. On March 31, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to its accounts receivable securitization program revising certain terms to strengthen the credit quality of the pool of receivables and increasing the interest rate. The credit facility supporting the borrowings under the program was also renewed and now expires on March 31, 2010. The size of the program continues to allow for aggregate borrowings and letters of credit of up to $175.0 million, as limited by eligible accounts receivable. Availability
As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had $300.0 million and $205.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, respectively. At September 30, 2009, the Company had availability of $560.0 million under the revolving credit facility.

At September 30, 2009, the Company had availability of $65.9 million under the accounts receivable securitization program.
The Company’s ability to issue commercial paper up to the $100.0 million maximum aggregate principal amount of the program has been affected by economic conditions. The commercial paper placement program is supported by a line of credit that has been renewed and expires on April 30, 2010. Fair Value of Long-Term Debt
At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s senior notes and other long-term debt, including amounts classified as current, was $1,901.4 million and $1,178.0 million, respectively."

2,2009-11-06,1000697,XBRL,"6 Debt In January 2007, the Company entered into a c
redit agreement (the “2007 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $500 million term loan facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility. The 2007 Credit Agreement matures on January 11, 2012 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the fact that the Company utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the Company’s intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the respective period end date. The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case plus a credit margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. The 2007 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. As of October 3, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. At October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had a total of $610 million and $500 million, respectively, borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement, of which $500 million was classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets at both dates. As of October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had a total amount available to borrow of $490 million and $599 million, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to these borrowings were 0.81% and 2.43% at October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $89 million and $88 million at October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the related short-term borrowings were $35 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.89% and $36 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.18%, respectively. 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various shareholder-approved stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units). The Company accounts fo
r stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the stock compensation accounting standard, which requires that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The stock compensation accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of this standard, the compensation expense that the Compa
ny records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards and the emp

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock optionees. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Schol
es model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008 are as follows: Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values October 3, 2009 &a

For both the three and nine months ended September 27, 2008, the Company had 1.3 million stock option securities that were antidi
lutive due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 5 Goodwill and Other Intangibles The carrying amount of goodwill was $293 million and $268 million at October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the Company’s acquisition of Thar, which increased goodwill by $22 million (Note 4). Currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by $3 million.

amp;#160; 201,079 7 years $ 328,223 $ 178,571 7 years During the nine months ended October 3, 2009, the Company acquired $24 mill
ion of purchased intangibles as a result of the acquisition of Thar. In addition, the gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets increased by $7 million and $5 million, respectively, in the nine months ended October 3, 2009 due to the effect of foreign currency translation. For the three months ende
d October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, amortization expense for intangible assets was $6 million and $7 million, respectively. For the nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, amortization expense for intangible assets was $19 million and $30 million, respectively. Included in amortization expense for the nine months ended September 27, 2008 is a $9 million out-of-period adjustment related to capitalized software. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be approximately $29 million for each of the next five years. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company implemented the newly issued accounting and disclosure requirements related to intangibles assets. This accounting standard provides guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and requires enhanced disclosures so that users of financial statements are able to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the Company’s intent and ability to renew or extend the arrangement. The adoption of this standard by the Company did not have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 7 Income Taxes The Company’s effective tax rates for the three months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008 were 19.2% and 23.5%, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rates for the nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008 were 16.3% and 14.1%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for the three months ended September 27, 2008 is approximately $5 million of tax provision associated with the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. This one-time provision increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 5.4 percentage points and 2.0 percentage points for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2008, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for the nine months ended October 3, 2009 is approximately $5 million of tax benefit associated with the reversal of the $5 million tax provision described above. The recognition of this tax benefit was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in February 2009. This $5 million tax benefit decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.7 percentage points for the nine months ended October 3, 2009. In addition, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2008 included a $16 million benefit resulting from the out-of-period adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The out-of-period adjustments had the effect of reducing the Company’s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in the nine months ended September 27, 2008. After consideration of these items, the remaining changes in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended October 3, 2009 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 27, 2008 are primarily attributable to changes in income in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008 (in thousands): October 3, 2009 September 27, 2008 Balance at the beginning of the period $&lt

ccrued as of October 3, 2009 were to become recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $75 million in the income tax provision. As of October 3, 2009, however, the Company is not able to estimate the portion of that total potential reduction that may occur within the next twelve months. 3 Inventories Inventories are classified as foll

During fiscal year 2009, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $9 million to $11 million to the defined benefit plans. 14 Recent Accounting Standards Changes and Developments Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued the accounting standard that establishes the hierarchy of GAAP that are to be used as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB for non-governmental entities in preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States. This standard was effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard by the Company did not have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-05, “Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value”. ASU 2009-05 amends ASU Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements”. Specifically, ASU 2009-05 provides clarification that, in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods: (1) a valuation technique that uses (a) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or (b) quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when trade
d as assets; and/or (2) a valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of Topic 820 of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). ASU 2009-05 also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued Financial Statement of Position (“FSP”) Financial Accounting Standard (“FAS”) 115-2, FSP FAS 124-2 and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 99-20-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments”. FSP FAS 115-2, FAS 124-2 and EITF 99-20-2 provide additional guidance to provide greater clarity about the credit and noncredit component of an other-than-temporary impairment event and to more effectively communicate when an other-than-temporary impairment event has occurred. This FSP applies to debt securities. This standard was effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have a material eff
ect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) 28-1, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”. FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 amend Statement of Financial Accounting Sta
ndards (“SFAS”) No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements. This FSP also amends APB Opinion 28, “Interim Financial Reporting”, to require those disclosures in all interim financial statements. This standard was effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. &
lt;/font> In the second quarter of 2009, the Company implemented the newly issued subsequent events accounting standard. This standard establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before financial statements are issued. The adoption of this standard did not impact the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after October 3, 2009 up through November 6, 2009, the date the Company issued these financial statements. During this period, the Company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard relating to the employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets. This requirement amends the previous accounting standard to provide guidance on employers’ disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This new standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The provisions of this new standard are not required for earlier periods presented and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, result
s of operations or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an amendment to Financial Interpretation (“FIN”) 46(R)”, which has not yet been integrated into the FASB ASC. This accounting standard will remain authoritative until the ASC is integrated. This statement addresses (1) the effects on certain provisions of FIN 46 as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept of SFAS No. 166 and (2) constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those in which the accounting and disclosures under FIN 46(R) do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable interest entity. This standard is effective for periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”. ASU 2009-13 amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of FASB ASC, Subtopic 605-25 (previously included within EITF 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”). The consensus to EITF Issue 08-01, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”, provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated. This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provid
es for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item. EITF 00-21 previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor. Under EITF 00-21, if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable, then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effec
t on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-14,“Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements”. ASU 2009-13, amends the existing accounting for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software that are currently within the scope of FASB ASC, Subtopic 985-605 (previously included within Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition”, as amended by SOP 98-9 “Modification of SOP 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions”). This consensus requires that tangible products which contain software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in ASC, Subtopic 985-605 and are required to be accounted for in accordance with ASU 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”. This new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 13 Business Segment Information The Comp
any’s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division. Waters Division is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two divisions are its operating segments and each has similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.

These systems are complementary products that can be integrated together and used along with other analytical instruments. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to puri
fy a full range of compounds. MS instruments are used in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”) and environmental testing. LC is often combined with MS to create LC-MS instruments that include a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. Through its TA Division (“TA”), the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments, which are used in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may not consist of thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s third fiscal quarters for 2009 and 2008 ended on October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly owned. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. &
lt;/font> The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as filed wit
h the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 27, 2009. Reclassifications Certain amounts from the prior year have been reclassi
fied in the accompanying financial statements in order to be consistent with the current year’s classifications. Fair Value Measurements Fair values of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt approximate cost. In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data point
s in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at October 3, 2009 (in thousands): Total at October 3, 2009 Quoted Prices in Active Market for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Cash equivalents $ 242,417 $ — $ 242,417 $ — Short-term investments 187,731 — 187,731 — Waters Retirement Restoration Plan assets 16,894 — &

p;#160; — $ 3,393 $ — The Company’s financial assets and liabilities have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, short-term investments, retirement restoration plan assets, foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. After completing these validation pr
ocedures, the Company did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by third-party pricing services as of October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008. In January 2009, the Company implemented the accounting and disclosure requirements related to non-financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The adoption of this accounting and disclosure requirement did not have a significant impact on the Company&amp
;#8217;s financial statements. Stockholders’ Equity In February 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the nine months ended October 3, 2009, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares at a cost of $103 million under this program. In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the Company repurchased 1.4 mil
lion and 3.4 million shares at a cost of $53 million and $209 million, respectively, under this program. As of October 3, 2009, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 8.5 million shares of its common stock under the now expired February 2007 program for an aggregate cost of $464 million. Hedge Transactions The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, which establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities includ
e the Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company’s financial position and performance. The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize for
eign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair-value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. The Company also considers the impact of our counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In August 2007, the Company entered into two floating-to-fixed-rate interest ra
te swaps, each with a notional amount of $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October 2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. At October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had a $1 million and $2 million liability, respectively, in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets related to the interest rate swap agreements. For the three and nine months ended October 3, 2009, the Company recorded a cumulative pre-tax unrealized gain of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate agreements. For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2008, the Company recorded a cumulative pre-tax unrealized gain of $1 million and a cumulative pre-tax unrealized gain of less than $1 million, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate a
greements. For both the three months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the Company recorded additional interest expense of less than $1 million. For the nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the Company recorded additional interest expense of $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Other<
/i> The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $153 mi
llion and $120 million, respectively. At October 3, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had liabilities of less than $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet related to the foreign currency exchange contract agreements. For the three months ended October 3, 2009, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of $4 million, which consists of realized losses of approximately $4 million relating to the closed forward contracts. For the nine months ended October 3, 2009, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of $6 million, which consists of realized gains of $5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward contracts. For the three months ended September 27, 2008, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of $4 million, which consists of realized losses of $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1 million unrealized losses relatin
g to the open forward contracts. For the nine months ended September 27, 2008, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of $3 million, which consists of approximately $3 million of realized losses relating to the open forward contracts. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008 (in thousands): Balance at&lt

ising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes the outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position. The Company has been engaged in ongoing patent litigation with Agilent Technologies GmbH in France and Germany. In January 2009, the French appeals court affirmed that the Company had infringed the Agilent Technologies GmbH patent and a judgment was issued against the Company. The Company has appealed this judgment. In 2008, the Company recorded a $7 million provision and, in the first quarter of 2009, the Company has made a payment of $6 million for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with the French litigation case. No provision has been made for the German patent litigation and the Company believes the outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position.

The 364-day credit agreement matures on June 2, 2010 and the three-year credit agreement matures on June 1, 2012. The credit agreements replaced (i) the $850 million revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature on November 17, 2009 and (ii) the $850 million revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature on June 29, 2009, each of which was terminated in accordance with its respective terms on June 3, 2009. Amounts due under the terminated credit agreements on the date of termination were repaid with the proceeds of its initial borrowings under the credit agreements. Borrowings under the credit agreements will bear interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin (defined below) or the alternate base rate then in effect plus the applicable margin minus 1.00%. The margin applicable to either a LIBOR or alternate base rate borrowing will be based on the greater of (i) a per annum floor rate that varies between 2.00% and 4.50% under the 364-day credit agreement and between 3.00% and 5.50% under the three-year credit agreement, each based generally on the credit ratings of Bunges senior long-term unsecured debt and (ii) a per annum rate calculated as a percentage of the Markit CDX.NA.IG Series 12 five-year credit default swap index (or successor index thereof) that varies between 85% and 175% each based generally on the credit ratings of Bunges senior long-term unsecured debt. Amounts under the credit agreements that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable quarterly on the average undrawn portion of the respective credit agreement at rates ranging from 0.375% to 1.00% under the 364-day credit agreement and from 0.75% to 2.00% under the three-year credit agreement, each varying based on the credit ratings of Bunges senior long-term unsecured debt. Senior notesIn June 2009, Bunge completed the sale of $600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes (senior notes), which bear interest at 8.50% per year. The senior notes will mature on June 15, 2019. The senior notes were issued by Bunges 100%-owned finance subsidiary, Bunge Limited Finance Corp, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Bunge Limited. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year, commencing in December 2009. Bunge used the net proceeds from this offering, of approximately $595 million after deducting underwriters commissions and offering expenses, to repay outstanding indebtedness. The fair value of Bunges long-term debt is based on
interest rates currently available on comparable maturities to
companies with credit standing similar to Bunge. The carrying
amounts and fair value of long-term debt are as follows: September 30, 2009 December 31, 2008 (US$ in millions) Carrying

Agreement, as Amended On
September 3, 2009 the Company amended the 2005 Walter Credit
Agreement (""Credit Agreement"") to extend the maturity date for the
Company's Revolving Credit Facility (""Revolver"") from
October 4, 2010 to July 2, 2012 and amend the size of the
Revolver to $300.0 million that, subject to certain
conditions, can be increased to $425.0 million. Prior to the
amendment, the Revolver was scheduled to be reduced from
$350.0 million to $300.0 million at September 30,
2009 and to $250.0 million at December 31, 2009. The
amendment also increases the interest rate on the Revolver by 100
basis points. The commitment fee on the unused portion of the
revolving facility was set at 0.5% per year for all pricing levels
compared to a range of 0.4% to 0.5% per year prior to the change.
In addition, certain financial covenants in the Credit Agreement
were eliminated. The amendment did not affect the term loan portion
of the Credit Agreement. As
of September 30, 2009, borrowings under the Credit Agreement
consisted of a term loan balance of $137.9 million with a
weighted average interest rate of 2.50%. The Credit Agreement is a
secured obligation of the Company and substantially all of its
wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. The term loan requires
quarterly principal payments of $0.4 million through
October 3, 2012 at which time the remaining outstanding
principal is due. The Revolver and the term loan currently bear
interest at LIBOR plus 300 and 225 basis points, respectively. As
of September 30, 2009, the Company had $64.9 million in
outstanding stand-by letters of credit, of which $15.7 million
relates to the support letter of credit discussed in Note 2,
$0 borrowings, and $235.1 million of availability for future
borrowings under the Revolver.
Other
Debt In
2008, the Company entered into a financing arrangement and a
capital lease arrangement to procure mining equipment. At
September 30, 2009, $28.0 million was outstanding at an
interest rate of 4.00% related to the equipment financing and
$8.1 million was outstanding at an implicit rate of 9.78%
related to the capital lease. In June 2009, the Company entered
into a $12.7 million arrangement to finance the premium
payments of its property insurance. The debt obligation is being
repaid in nine monthly installments of $1.4 million that began
in July 2009 and has an interest rate of 3.90%. As of
September 30, 2009, $8.5 million was outstanding. In
addition, as of September 30, 2009, $0.3 million of other
debt was outstanding.

7. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS
AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS On
September 24, 2009, the Company completed a debt tender

including an early tender premium but excluding accrued interest,
fees and expenses, of up to $1.2 billion of the following series of
debt securities (listed in order of acceptance priority):
(i) 7.80% Debentures due October 15, 2016 of Allegiance
Corporation; (ii) 6.75% Notes due February 15, 2011 of
the Company; (iii) 6.00% Notes due June 15, 2017 of the

The holders of our
contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase,
in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal
amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten,
fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The notes are
convertible, at the holder’s option, prior to maturity under
certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of our
common stock using a net share settlement process. One such
triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock
exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal
quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured
quarter by quarter. In the third quarter of 2009, the price of our
common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the
contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period
and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert
their notes into cash and common stock in the fourth quarter of
2009 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the
holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the
trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by
reference to the trading price of our common stock. In general,
upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder
will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and
common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of
such principal amount. We will pay contingent interest on the
convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least
ten years, under certain conditions. We may redeem the convertible
senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes,
payable in cash. The optional repurchase dates, the common stock
price conversion threshold amounts and the ending date of the first
six-month period contingent interest may be payable for the
contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Repurchase

Conversion and Other Options. Discount at September 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008 included $859 million and $1.009
billion, respectively, associated with the equity component of our
contingent convertible senior notes. (d)
See Note 2 for discussion
related to these instruments. Senior
Notes Our senior
notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank
equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future
senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of
our future subordinated indebtedness. Our senior note obligations
are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. See
Note 13 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding
our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries. We may redeem the
senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes,
at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Senior
notes issued before July 2005 are governed by indentures containing
covenants that limit our ability and our restricted
subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay
dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our
capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and
other restricted payments; incur liens; enter into sale/leaseback
transactions; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or
other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; engage in
transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge
or transfer assets. Senior notes issued after June 2005 are
governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability
and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured
indebtedness; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and
consolidate, merge or transfer assets. Chesapeake
Energy Corporation is a holding company and owns no operating
assets and has no significant operations independent of its
subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2008, our obligations under
our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible notes were
fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all
of our wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries, other than minor
subsidiaries, on a senior unsecured basis. In October 2008, we
restructured our midstream operations. As a result, beginning in
the fourth quarter of 2008, our wholly-owned midstream subsidiaries
having significant assets and operations do not guarantee our
outstanding senior notes. During the
Current Period, holders of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior
Notes due 2038 exchanged approximately $238 million in aggregate
principal amount for an aggregate of 6,707,321 shares of our common
stock in privately negotiated exchanges. No scheduled
principal payments are required under our senior notes until 2013
when $864 million is due. On
January 1, 2009, we adopted and applied retrospectively the
provisions of ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other
Options. We have three debt issuances affected by this change:
our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5%
Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25%
Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038. ASC 470-20 requires
us to account for the liability and equity components of our
convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest
expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the
time of issuance (6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively).
Additionally, debt issuance costs are required to be allocated in
proportion to the liability and equity components and accounted for
as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively. The
allocation to the equity component of the convertible notes was
$845 million (net of tax) at December 31, 2008. The accretion
of the resulting discount on the debt is recognized as a part of
interest expense, thereby increasing the amount of interest expense
required to be recognized with respect to such instruments. Given
the increase in our overall effective interest rate after adoption
of ASC 470-20, we also capitalized additional interest which
largely offset the increase in interest expense. The following
table summarizes the effect of the change in accounting principle

secured by certain producing natural gas and oil properties and
bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the
reference rate of Union Bank, N.A. or the federal funds effective
rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies
from 0.00% to 0.75% per annum according to our senior
unsecured long-term debt ratings, or (ii) the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to
2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term
debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are
determined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is
subject to a commitment fee of 0.50%. Interest is payable quarterly
or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent
intervals. The credit
facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive
provisions which limit our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The
credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness
(excluding discount on senior notes) to total capitalization ratio
(as defined) not to exceed 0.70 to 1 and an indebtedness to EBITDA
ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.75 to 1. As defined by the
credit facility agreement, our indebtedness to total capitalization
ratio was 0.41 to 1 and our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 3.48
to 1 at September 30, 2009. If we should fail to perform our
obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit
commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under
the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such
acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million ($50
million in the case of our senior notes issued after 2004), would
constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures,
which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant
portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility
agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other
indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an
outstanding principal amount in excess of $75 million. The facility is
fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis,
by Chesapeake and all of our other wholly-owned restricted
subsidiaries. CMD Credit
Facility Our Chesapeake
Midstream Development, L.P. (CMD) $250 million syndicated revolving
bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures to build
natural gas gathering and other systems for our drilling program
and for general corporate purposes associated with our midstream
operations. Borrowings under the CMD credit facility are secured by
all of the assets of the wholly-owned subsidiaries (the restricted
subsidiaries) of CMD, itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Chesapeake, and bear interest at our option at either (i) the
greater of the reference rate of Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and the
one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which would be subject to a
margin that varies from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum according to
the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) or
(ii) the LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 3.00% to
3.75% per annum according to the most recent indebtedness to
EBITDA ratio (as defined). The unused portion of the facility is
subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum according to
the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined). Interest
is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be paid at more
frequent intervals. The CMD credit
facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive
provisions which limit the ability of CMD and its restricted
subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or
loans and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires
maintenance of an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to
exceed 3.50 to 1, and an EBITDA (as defined) to interest expense
coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1. As defined by the credit
facility agreement, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 0.01 to 1
and our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio was 6.62 to 1 at
September 30, 2009. If CMD or its restricted subsidiaries
should fail to perform their obligations under these and other
covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and
any outstanding borrowings under the CMD facility could be declared
immediately due and payable. The CMD credit facility agreement also
has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness CMD
and its restricted subsidiaries may have with an outstanding
principal amount in excess of $15 million. CMP Credit
Facility Our Chesapeake
Midstream Partners, L.L.C. (CMP) $500 million syndicated revolving
bank credit facility was established concurrent with the midstream
joint venture we formed on September 30, 2009 (see Note 8 for
discussion regarding the midstream joint venture). As a result of
that transaction, our existing CMD credit facility was amended and
restated. Borrowings under the CMP credit facility are secured by
all of the assets of the companies organized under CMP, which is
50% owned by Chesapeake and 50% owned by our joint venture partner
Global Infrastructure Partners, and bear interest at our option at
either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, the federal funds effective rate plus
0.50%, and the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which would be
subject to a margin that varies from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum
according to the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as
defined) or (ii) the LIBOR plus a margin that varies from
3.00% to 3.75% per annum according to the most recent
indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined). The unused portion of
the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum
according to the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as
defined). Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it
may be paid at more frequent intervals. The CMP credit
facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive
provisions which limit the ability of CMP and its subsidiaries to
incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create
liens. The credit facility agreement requires maintenance of an
indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.50 to 1,
and an EBITDA (as defined) to interest expense coverage ratio of
not less than 3.00 to 1. As defined by the credit facility
agreement, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 0.09 to 1 and our
EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio was 17.49 to 1 at
September 30, 2009. If CMP or its subsidiaries should fail to
perform their obligations under these and other covenants, the
revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding
borrowings under the CMP facility could be declared immediately due
and payable. The CMP credit facility agreement also has cross
default provisions that apply to other indebtedness CMP and its
subsidiaries may have with an outstanding principal amount in
excess of $15 million. "

852,767 Issuance of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 On February 13, 2009, we issued $420 million of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (“2016 Notes”). The 2016 Notes, which carry a coupon rate of 9.75%, were sold at a discount (92.816% of par), which equates to an effective yield to maturity of approximately 11.25%. The net proceeds of $381.4 million were used to repay most of our then-outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility, which increased from the December 31, 2008 balance, primarily associated with the funding of the Hastings Field acquisition (see Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures”). In conjunction with this debt offering we amended our bank credit facility in early February 2009, which, among other things, allowed us to issue these senior subordinated notes. In June 2009, we issued an additional $6.35 million of 2016 Notes to our founder, Gareth Roberts, as part of a Founder’s Retirement Agreement. In connection with this issuance, we recorded compensation expense of $6.35 million in “General and administrative” expense in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations during the second quarter. The 2016 Notes mature on March 1, 2016, and interest on the 2016 Notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2009. We may redeem the 2016 Notes in whole or in part at our option beginning March 1, 2013, at the following redemption prices: 104.875% after March 1, 2013, 102.4375% after March 1, 2014, and 100%, after March 1, 2015. In addition, we may at our option, redeem up to an aggregate of 35% of the 2016 Notes before March 1, 2012 at a price of 109.75%. The indenture contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends on our common stock, make investments, create liens on our assets, engage in transactions with our affiliates, transfer or sell assets, consolidate or merge, or sell substantially all of our assets. The 2016 Notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. All of our significant subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee this debt. Senior Bank Loan To clarify that Denbury entities are allowed to guarantee obligations of other Denbury entities, in May 2009 we amended our Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the instrument governing our Senior Bank Loan, to explicitly permit these guarantees and waive any possible previous technical violations of this provision. In June 2009 we again amended our Senior Bank Loan agreement in connection with the sale of our Barnett Shale natural gas properties and (i) reduced our borrowing base from $1.0 billion to $900 million and (ii) allowed for an additional percentage of our forecasted production to be hedged through June 30, 2009. The amendment did not impact the banks’ commitment amount, which remains at $750 million. On November 1, 2009, Denbury and Encore Acquisition Company announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Denbury will acquire Encore in a stock and cash transaction. Denbury received a commitment letter from J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., subject to certain funding conditions, for a proposed new $1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility with a term of four years, the proceeds from which would be used to pay down our existing Senior Bank Loan and other related financing. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations — Overview — Definitive Merger Agreement to Acquire Encore Acquisition Company” for further details. "

13. Amendment to Credit Agreement In February 2009, the Company entered into a “Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Pledge Agreement” (the “Fourth Amendment”). The Fourth Amendment amended, among other things, the Company’s Credit Agreement dated October 31, 2006 (the “Credit Agreement”). The Fourth Amendment provided the Company with additional flexibility to enhance certain operational and financial aspects of its business, including, among other things, undertaking an internal corporate realignment of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. A substantial portion of the realignment was completed in connection with the execution of the Fourth Amendment. This corporate realignment did not impact the composition of the Company’s four operating segments. Among other things, the Fourth Amendment provided the Company with the ability to repurchase and retire, from time to time through December 2010, up to $25.0 million of its outstanding term debt under its Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment did not change the base interest rate, interest rate spreads, financial covenants or other key terms of the Credit Agreement. See Note 15, “Subsequent Events.” "

As of September 30, 2009, we had total available capacity under various credit agreements (not including capacity available under the EPB $750 million revolving credit facility and all project financings) of approximately $1.4 billion. In determining our available capacity, we have assessed our lender’s ability to fund under our various credit facilities, as further discussed in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the first nine months of 2009, we increased the size of or entered into new letter of credit facilities totaling $275 million. As of September 30, 2009, we had total letter of credit capacity under these facilities of $300 million with a weighted average fixed facility fee of 6.77% and maturities ranging from December 2013 to September 2014. Additionally, during 2009, $300 million of letter of credit facilities entered into in 2007 matured. The availability of borrowings under our credit agreements and our ability to incur additional debt is subject to various financial and non-financial covenants and restrictions. These restrictions include potential limitations in the credit agreements of certain of our subsidiaries on their ability to declare and pay dividends and loan funds to us. As of December 31, 2008, the restricted net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries were approximately $1 billion. Additionally, the revolving credit facility of our exploration and production subsidiary is collateralized by certain of our natural gas and oil properties and has a borrowing base subject to revaluation on a semi-annual basis. Our existing borrowing base was approved by the banks in May 2009 and will be redetermined in November 2009. There have been no significant changes to our restrictive covenants from those disclosed in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and as of September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Letters of Credit.
We enter into letters of credit in the ordinary course of our operating activities as well as periodically in conjunction with the sales of assets or businesses. As of September 30, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit issued under all of our facilities of approximately $1.5 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $0.8 billion of letters of credit securing our recorded obligations related to price risk management activities. Other.
During the second quarter of 2009, our wholly owned subsidiary, Elba Express Company, secured a $165 million non-recourse financing facility which is available only to the related pipeline project. As of September 30, 2009, $129 million has been borrowed under this facility. During the third quarter of 2009, Ruby, a consolidated variable interest entity, entered into a loan commitment for $405 million, which is available only to fund the Ruby pipeline project. As of September 30, 2009, $157 million has been borrowed by Ruby under this loan commitment. In addition, during 2008 our wholly owned subsidiary, Ruby Pipeline L.L.C., entered into a letter of credit facility which is available only to secure the purchase of pipe for the Ruby pipeline project and in 2009 this facility was amended to provide up to $145 million in loans. As of September 30, 2009, $116 million has been borrowed under this facility. For a
further discussion of Ruby, see Note 13.

1,2009-11-09,895648,HTML," NOTE 4 MORTGAGES, NOTES AND LOANS PAYABLE Mortgages, notes and loans payable are summarized as
follows: September 30, December 31, 2009 2008 (In thousands) Fixed-rate debt: Collateralized mortgages, notes and loans
payable $ 15,860,334 $ 15,538,825 Corporate and other unsecured term loans 3,719,931 3,701,615 Total fixed-rate debt 19,580,265 19,240,440 Variable-rate debt: Collateralized mortgages, notes and loans
payable 2,500,542 2,732,437 Corporate and other unsecured term loans 2,783,700 2,783,700 Total variable-rate debt 5,284,242 5,516,137 Total mortgages, notes and loans payable $ 24,864,507 $ 24,756,577 As previously discussed, on April 16 and 22, 2009,
the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11,
which triggered defaults on substantially all debt obligations of
the Debtors. However, under section 362 of Chapter 11, the filing
of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays most actions against
the debtors estate. Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, these
pre-petition liabilities are subject to settlement under a plan of
reorganization, and therefore are presented as Liabilities subject
to compromise on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of the total
amount of debt presented above, $3.03 billion is not subject to
compromise, consisting primarily of the collateralized mortgages of
Non-Debtors and the DIP Facility as defined and described
below. The weighted-average interest rate including the effects
of interest rate swaps, excluding the effects of deferred finance
costs and using the contract rate prior to any defaults on such
loans, on our mortgages, notes and loans payable was 5.32% at
September 30, 2009 and 5.36% at December 31, 2008. The weighted average interest rate, using the contract rate prior
to any defaults on such loans, on the remaining corporate unsecured
fixed and variable rate debt and the revolving credit facility was
4.26% at September 30, 2009 and 4.29% at December 31,
2008. We are currently recognizing interest expense on our loans
based on contract rates in effect prior to bankruptcy as the
Bankruptcy Court has ruled that interest payments based on such
contract rates constitutes adequate protection to the secured
lenders. As of September 30, 2009, $24.47 billion of land,
buildings and equipment and developments in progress (before
accumulated depreciation) have been pledged as collateral for our
mortgages, notes and loans payable. Although substantially all of
the $24.86 billion of fixed and variable rate mortgage notes and
loans payable are non-recourse to us, $2.65 billion of such
mortgages, notes and loans payable are recourse to us due to
guarantees or other security provisions for the benefit of the note
holder. In addition, certain mortgage loans contain other credit
enhancement provisions (primarily master leases for all or a
portion of the property), as of September 30, 2009 provided by
Debtors upon which we do not expect to perform during the pendency
of our Chapter 11 Cases. Certain mortgage notes payable may be
prepaid but are generally subject to a prepayment penalty equal to
a yield-maintenance premium, defeasance or a percentage of the loan
balance. Debtor-in-Possession Facility On May 14, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order
authorizing certain Debtors to enter into a Senior Secured Debtor
in Possession Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement among the
Company, as co-borrower, GGP Limited Partnership, as co-borrower,
certain of their subsidiaries, as guarantors, UBS AG, Stamford
Branch, as agent (the DIP Agent), and the lenders party thereto
(the DIP Facility). The DIP Facility, which closed on May 15, 2009,
provides for an aggregate commitment of $400.0 million (the
DIP Term Loan), which was used to refinance the $215.0 million
remaining balance on the Short-term Secured Loan and the remainder
of which will provide additional liquidity to the Debtors during
the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, including to fund our
portion of venture mortgage loans (Note 3). The DIP Facility
provides that principal outstanding on the DIP Term Loan bears
interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a minimum
LIBOR floor of 1.5%) plus 12% and matures at the earlier of
May 16, 2011 or the effective date of a plan of reorganization
of the Debtors and has an outstanding balance of $400.0 million at
September 30, 2009. Subject to certain conditions being present, the Company
will have the right to elect to repay all or a portion of the
outstanding principal amount of the DIP Term Loan, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and all exit fees at maturity, by issuing
(i) common stock of the Company to the lenders (the Equity
Conversion) or (ii) debt to the lenders, which would be
issued for a three-year term, prepayable at any time without
penalty or premium, and otherwise on terms substantially similar to
those of the DIP Term Loan. Any Equity Conversion will be limited
to the lenders receipt of Company common stock equaling no more
than (i) 8.0% of the Company common stock distributed in
connection with the Debtors plan of reorganization, as confirmed
by the Bankruptcy Court (the Plan of Reorganization) on a
fully-diluted basis, or (ii) 9.9% of the Company common stock
actually distributed in connection with the Plan of Reorganization
on its effective date, without giving effect to common stock held
back for the payment of contingencies. The DIP Credit Agreement
contains customary non-financial covenants, representations and
warranties, and events of default. Although the DIP Agreement
contains no financial covenants, it does include obligations to
periodically provide certain operating information concerning the
Debtors directly to the DIP Agent.

(2) The Yen Term Loan matured on March 30, 2009. Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationships Enterprise Products Partners L.P. acts as guarantor of the consolidated debt obligations of EPO with the exception of the DEP Revolving Credit Facility and the DEP Term Loan. If EPO were to default on any of its guaranteed debt, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. would be responsible for full repayment of that obligation. Letters of Credit At September 30, 2009, EPO had outstanding a $50.0 million letter of credit relating to its commodity derivative instruments and a $58.3 million letter of credit related to its Petal GO Zone Bonds. These letter of credit facilities do not reduce the amount available for borrowing under EPO’s credit facilities. In addition, at September 30, 2009, Duncan Energy Partners had an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of $1.0 million which reduces the amount available for borrowing under its credit facility. EPO’s Debt Obligations&l
t;/div> Apart from that discussed below, there have been no significant changes in the terms of our debt obligations since those reported in our Recast Form 8-K. $200.0 Million Term Loan. In April 2009, EPO entered into a $200.0 Million Term Loan, w
hich was subsequently repaid and terminated in June 2009 using funds from the issuance of Senior Notes P (see below). Senior Notes P. In June 2009, EPO issued $500.0 million in principal amount of 3-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes P”). Senior Notes P were issued at 99.95% of their principal amount, have a fixed interest rate of 4.60% and mature on August 1, 2012. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes P were used (i) to repay amounts borrowed und
er the $200 Million Term Loan, (ii) to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) for general partnership purposes. Senior Notes P rank equal with EPO’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. They are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO. Senior Notes P are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under indentures containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO’s ability, with certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility. In November 2008, EPO executed a standby 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the “364-Day Facility”) that had a borrowing capacity of $375.0 million. The 364-Day Facility was terminated in June 2009 under its terms as a result of the issuance of Senior Notes P. No amounts were borrowed under this standby facility through its termination date. Exchange Offers for TEPPCO Notes. In September 2009, EPO commenced offers to exchange all outstanding notes issued by TEPPCO for a corresponding series of new notes to be issued by EPO and guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. The aggregate principal amount of the TEPPCO notes subject to the exchange was $2 billion. The exchange offer was completed on October 27, 2009, resulting in the exchange of approximately $1.95 billion of new EPO notes for existing TEPPCO notes. See Note 18 for additional information regarding this exchange offer. Senior Notes Q and R. In October 2009, EPO issued $500.0 million in principal amount of 10-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes Q”) and $600.0 million in principal amount of 30-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes R”). EPO used a portion of the net proceeds it received from the issuance of Senior Notes Q and R to repay its $500.0 million in principal amount unsecured notes (“Senior Notes F”) that matured in October 2009. See Note 18 for additional information regarding these debt issuances.<
/div> Dixie Revolving Credit Facility The Dixie Revolving Credit Facility was terminated in January 2009. As of December 31, 2008, there were no debt obligations outstanding under this facility. Covenants We were in compliance with the covenants of our consolidated debt agreements at September 30, 2009. Information Regarding Variable Intere

mp;nbsp; 11,359 Exchangeable Senior Debentures During the second quarter of 2009, Liberty used cash for the voluntary early retirement of $750 million face amount of its Exchangeable Senior Debentures attributable to Liberty Capital. Liberty paid $187.5 million (of which $37.5 million was existing cash collateral) to retire $400 million face amount of its 4% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2029 and $350 million face amount of its 3-3/4% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2030. Liberty also terminated swap arrangements that reference the 4% and 3-3/4% Exchangeable Senior Debentures with no additional payment. The total cash used to retire the $750 m
illion face amount of Exchangeable Senior Debentures and swaps referencing these Exchangeable Senior Debentures was $503 million, of which $315 million was paid to settle swap arrangements that were settled in November 2008. Liberty also purchased and retired $126 million principal amount of its 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures for aggregate cash payments of $106 million. LibertyDerivative Loan During the first quarter of 2009, Liberty made additional net borrowings of $1,638 million against the present value of its Sprint derivatives. Such debt is due when the derivatives expire in 2009 and 2010 and is expected to be retired by the offset of debt left against amounts to be received by Liberty upon expiration of the derivatives. In this regard, in the second quarter of 2009, Liberty repaid $333 million of the Sprint deriva
tive loan with cash on hand. In addition, in the third quarter of 2009, Liberty repaid $775 million of the Sprint derivative loans. In the third quarter of 2009, certain Sprint derivatives expired, and Liberty received cash proceeds of $1,027 million. QVC 7.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 During the third quarter of 2009, QVC issued $1.0 billion principal amount of 7.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the ""QVC Notes"") at an issue price of 98.278%. QVC used the net proceeds from such offering to fund the purchase and cancellation of outstanding term loans under QVC's senior secured credit facilities that mature in 2014. &lt
;i>QVC Bank Credit Facilities Effective June 16, 2009, QVC amended each of its bank credit agreements (the ""Amended Credit Agreements""). Concurrent with the execution of the Amended Credit Agreements, QVC retired $750 million of loans at par and cancelled another $19 million of unfunded commitments at no cost. As noted above, QVC purchased and cancelled outstanding term loans under its Amended Credit Agreements with proceeds from the issuance of the QVC Notes. The remaining $3.23 billion outstanding principal matures in six tranches between June 2010 a
nd March 2014 as follows: $500 million due in 2010; $702 million due in 2011; $400 million due in 2012; $400 million due in 2013; and $1,233 million due in 2014. In connection with the execution of the Amended Credit Agreements, those lenders consenting to the amendments, which held loans in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $4.23 billion, received certain modified loan terms, including (i
) adjusted interest rate margins of 350 to 550 basis points depending on the tranche maturity, (ii) reductions in QVC's maximum leverage ratio, (iii) additional restrictions on creating additional indebtedness and (iv) mandatory prepayment in the event of certain asset sales by QVC. Loans held by the non-consenting lenders, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $252 million, will continue to receive an interest rate margin of up to 100 basis points with their loans maturing in 2011. All other terms of the Amended Credit Agreements will apply to these loans. &
lt;p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 10.8pt; font-family: Courier; text-align: justify;"">Cash used to retire the $750 million of loans came from a combination of $250 million in cash from QVC and $250 million in the form of an intergroup loan from each of the Entertainment Group and the Capital Group to the Interactive Group. Such intergroup loans (i) are secured by various public stocks attributed to the Interactive Group, (ii) accrue interest quarterly at the rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points and (iii) are due June 16, 2010. QVC was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at September 30, 2009. QVC Interest Rate Swap Arrangements QVC is party to ten separate interest rate swap arrangements with an aggregate notional amount of $2,200 million to manage the cash flow risk associated with interest payments on its variable rate debt. The swap arrangements provide for QVC to make fixed payments at rates ranging from 4.9575% to 5.2928% and to receive variable payments at 3 month LIBOR. All of the swap arrangements expire in March 2011. Until December 2008, Liberty accounted for the swap arrangements as cash flow hedges with the effective portions of changes in the fair value reflected in other comprehensive earnings in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. In December 2008, QVC elected interest terms under its credit facilities that do not effectively match the terms of the swa
p arrangements. As a result, the swaps no longer qualify as cash flow hedges under GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swaps are now reflected in realized and unrealized gains or losses on financial instruments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. QVC is also party to two interest rate swap arrangements wit
h an aggregate notional amount of $600 million. These swap arrangements, which expire in October 2010, provide for QVC to make fixed payments at 3.07% and to receive variable payments at 3 month LIBOR. These swap arrangements do not qualify as cash flow hedges under GAAP. During the third quarter of 2009, QVC entered into seven new forward interest rate swap arrangements with an aggregate notional amount of $1.75 billion. Such arrangements provide for payments beginning in March 2011 and extending to March 2013. QVC will make fixed payments at rates ranging from 2.98% to 3.67% and receive variable paymen
ts at 3 month LIBOR. These swap arrangements are not accounted for as cash flow hedges. DIRECTV Collar Loan In April 2008, Liberty entered in
to an equity collar (the ""DIRECTV Collar"") with respect to 110 million shares of DIRECTV common stock and a related credit facility (the ""Collar Loan"") against the present value of the put value of such collar. At the time of closing, Liberty borrowed $1,977 million. The Collar Loan is due as the DIRECTV Collar terminates in six tranches from June 2009 through August 2012. Each tranche is repayable during a six-month period based upon a formula that factors in several variables including the market price of DIRECTV common stock. Interest accrues at an effective weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and is due and payable as each tranche matures. Borrowings are collateralized by the puts underlying the Collar Loan and 170 million shares of DIRECTV common stock owned by Liberty. In November 2008, Liberty chose to unwind 50% of the first tranche of the DIRECTV Collar. The first tranche expires in 2009 and originally had 22.5 million DIRECTV shares underlying it. As part of this transaction, Liberty repaid the portion of the Collar Loan ($228.4 million) associated with the shares that were unwound. Such repayment was funded with (1) proceeds from the collar unwind ($45.5 million), (2) funds borrowed from the remaining capacity of the Collar Loan ($181.1 million) and (3) cash on hand ($1.8 million). As a result of this transaction, the amount of the Collar Loan due in 2009 is approximately $258 million including accrued interest, of which $146 million was paid through September 30, 2009. The DIRECTV Collar contains a provisio
n that allows the counterparty to terminate a portion of the DIRECTV Collar if the total number of shares of DIRECTV underlying the DIRECTV Collar exceeds 20% of the outstanding public float of DIRECTV common stock. In the event the counterparty chooses to terminate a portion of the DIRECTV Collar, the repayment of the corresponding debt would be accelerated. As of September 30, 2009, the number of shares of DIRECTV common stock underlying the DIRECTV Collar represented approximately 24% of the outstanding public float of DIRECTV common stock. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the counterparty had not elected to terminate a portion of the collar. Other Subsidiary Debt Other subsidiary debt at September 30, 2009 is comprised of capitalized satellite transponder lease obligations and bank debt of certain subsidiaries. Fair Value of Debt Libertyestimates the fair value of its debt based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rate offered to Liberty for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of Liberty's publicly traded debt securities that are not reported at fair value in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2009 is as follows (amounts in millions): Fixed rate senior notes $ 758 Senior debentures $ 704 The fair value of the QVC Notes was approximately $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2009. Due to the low risk nature of the Collar Loan, Liberty believes that the carrying amount approximates fair value. Due to its variable rate nature, Liberty believes that the carrying amount of its subsidiary debt and other parent debt approximated fair value at September 30, 2009. "

p;nbsp; Total notes payable $ 521,662 $ 643,811 Substantially all of our debt was acquired in connection with a property or other acquisition, and in such cases an initial premium or discount is established for any difference between the stated note balance and estimated fair value. This initial premium or discount is amortized over the remaining term of the notes using the effective interest method. Estimated fair values are based upon discounting the future cash flows under each respective note at an interest rate that approximates those of loans with similar credit characteristics and term to maturity. These inputs for fair value represent significant unobservable inputs, which are “Level 3” inputs as the term is defined in the Codification. At September 30, 2009, we have a revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which expires on March 27, 2012, with an aggregate limit with respect to borrowings and letters of credit of $300 million. Amounts drawn on the Credit Agreement bear an annual interest rate ranging from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.35% to LIBOR plus 1.00% depending on our credit ratings (LIBOR plus 0.35% at September 30, 2009). In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from 0.10% per annum to 0.25% per annum depending on our credit ratings (0.10% per annum at September 30, 2009). We had no outstanding borrowings on our Credit Agreement at September 30, 2009 or at November 6, 2009. At September 30, 2009, we had undrawn standby letters of credit, which reduce our borrowing capability with respect to our line of credit by the amount of the letters of credit, totaling $18,270,000 ($17,736,000 at December 31, 2008). On February 12, 2009, we acquired $110,223,000 face amount ($113,736,000 book value) of our existing unsecured notes pursuant to a tender offer for an aggregate of $109,622,000 in cash (including costs associated with the tender of $414,000) plus accrued interest. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a gain of $4,114,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, representing the difference between the book value of $113,736,000 and the retirement amount paid plus tender offer costs.
Our notes payable and our Credit Agreement each have various customary restrictive covenants, all of which have been met at September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009, approximate principal maturities of our notes payable are as follows (amounts in thousands): &

9,2009-11-09,1050915,XBRL," 8. DEBT: Credit Facility Quanta has a credit facility with various lenders that provides for a $475.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on September 19, 2012. Subject to the conditions specified in the credit facility, borrowings under the credit facility are to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire unused portion of the credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of September 30, 2009, Quanta had approximately $183.9 million of letters of credit issued under the credit facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining $291.1 million was available for revolving loans or issuing new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 0.875% to 1.75%, as determined by the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility), or (b) the base rate (as described below) plus 0.00% to 0.75%, as determined by the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the credit facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.875% to 1.75%, based on the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the credit facility. The base rate equals the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1/2 of 1% or (ii) the bank’s prime rate. The credit facility contains certain covenants, including covenants with respect to maximum funded debt to consolidated EBITDA, maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA and minimum interest coverage, in each case as specified in the credit facility. For purposes of calculating the maximum funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio and the maximum senior debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio, Quanta’s maximum funded debt and maximum senior debt are reduced by all cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the credit facility) held by Quanta in excess of $25.0 million. As of September 30, 2009, Quanta was in compliance with all of its covenants. The credit facility limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material assets. The credit facility also limits the payment of dividends and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock. The credit facility provides for customary events of default and carries cross-default provisions with all of Quanta’s existing subordinated notes, its continuing indemnity and security agreement with its sureties and all of its other debt instruments exceeding $15.0 million in borrowings. If an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit facility, amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries and substantially all of its assets. Quanta’s U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit facility. Quanta’s obligations under the credit facility constitute designated senior indebtedness under its 3.75% convertible subordinated notes. 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes At September 30, 2009, Quanta had outstanding $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2026 (3.75% Notes). The resale of the notes and the shares issuable upon conversion thereof was registered for the benefit of the holders in a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The 3.75% Notes mature on April 30, 2026 and bear interest at the annual rate of 3.75%, payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30, until maturity. The $122.3 million and $125.5 million of convertible subordinated notes on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009 is presented net of a debt discount of $21.5 million and $18.3 million, which is amortized as interest expense over the remaining amortization period. This debt discount was recorded in accordance with the January 1, 2009 adoption of FSP APB 14-1 (ASC 470-20) as discussed in Notes 1 and 3. The effective interest rate used to calculate total interest expense for the 3.75% Notes under FSP APB 14-1 (ASC 470-20) was 7.85%. At September 30, 2009, the remaining amortization period of the debt discount is approximately 3.6 years. The 3.75% Notes are convertible into Quanta’s common stock, based on an initial conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of Quanta’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.75% Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.41 per share), subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The 3.75% Notes are convertible by the holder (i) during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of Quanta’s common stock is greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, (ii) upon Quanta calling the 3.75% Notes for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence of specified distributions to holders of Quanta’s common stock or specified corporate transactions or (iv) at any time on or after March 1, 2026 until the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 3.75% Notes. The 3.75% Notes are not presently convertible, although they have been convertible in certain prior quarters as a result of the satisfaction of the market price condition described in clause (i) above. If the 3.75% Notes become convertible under any of these circumstances, Quanta has the option to deliver cash, shares of Quanta’s common stock or a combination thereof, with the amount of cash determined in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes were issued. Conversions that may occur in the future could result in the recording of losses on extinguishment of debt if the conversions are settled in cash for an amount in excess of the principal amount. The holders of the 3.75% Notes who convert their notes in connection with certain change in control transactions, as defined in the indenture, may be entitled to a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. In the event of a change in control, in lieu of paying holders a make whole premium, if applicable, Quanta may elect, in some circumstances, to adjust the conversion rate and related conversion obligations so that the 3.75% Notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company. Beginning on April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013, Quanta may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Quanta’s common stock is equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price then in effect for the 3.75% Notes for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of mailing of the notice of redemption. In addition, Quanta may redeem for cash all or part of the 3.75% Notes at any time on or after April 30, 2010 at certain redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Beginning with the six-month interest period commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month interest period thereafter, Quanta will be required to pay contingent interest on any outstanding 3.75% Notes during the applicable interest period if the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes during the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the last trading day before commencement of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the notes. The contingent interest payable within any applicable interest period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading price of the 3.75% Notes during a five trading day reference period. The holders of the 3.75% Notes may require Quanta to repurchase all or a part of the notes in cash on each of April 30, 2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2021, and in the event of a change in control of Quanta, as defined in the indenture, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 3.75% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 3.75% Notes carry cross-default provisions with Quanta’s other debt instruments exceeding $20.0 million in borrowings, which includes Quanta’s existing credit facility. 4.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes During 2008, the holders of $269.8 million aggregate principal amount of Quanta’s 4.5% convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (4.5% Notes) elected to convert their notes, resulting in the issuance of 24,229,781 shares of Quanta’s common stock, substantially all of which followed a notice of redemption by Quanta that it would redeem on October 8, 2008 all of the 4.5% Notes outstanding pursuant to the indenture governing the notes. Quanta also repurchased $106,000 aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes on October 1, 2008 pursuant to the holders’ election and redeemed for cash $49,000 aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on October 8, 2008. As a result of all of these transactions, none of the 4.5% Notes remained outstanding as of October 8, 2008. The 4.5% Notes were originally issued in October 2003 for an aggregate principal amount of $270.0 million and required semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 until maturity. "

we entered into a 364-Day Secured Liquidity Credit Facility
Agreement with National City Bank (NCB). Under this agreement, we
may borrow up to $125 million, which may be increased to $150
million at our request but subject to NCB’s discretion. In
conjunction with this agreement, we deposited $125 million into an
FDIC-insured deposit account at NCB in January 2009 to provide us
with additional cash availability in the event of a disruption to
our cash management operations. Our access to these funds is
unrestricted. However, if we withdraw funds from this account for
any reason other than in connection with such a disruption in our
cash management operations, the availability of borrowings under
the NCB credit facility will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar
basis until such time as we replenish the funds to the deposit
account. The credit facility will expire on December 31, 2009,
unless earlier terminated according to its terms. We had no
borrowings under this arrangement in 2008 or through the first nine
months of 2009.

Net proceeds of $991.1 million were received in connection with the offering and were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under a $1.0 billion bridge loan facility expiring August 2009. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company, carry a combined effective interest rate of 9.44 percent and require semi-annual interest payments. In March 2009, the Company entered into a $525.0 million term loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions (the “Lenders”) which remained undrawn as of June 30, 2009. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company allowed all commitments under the term loan facility to expire and entered into a new $375.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with the Lenders. The revolving credit agreement allows for the election of interest at a base rate, or a Eurodollar rate of LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and requires the payment of a quarterly commitment fee of 32.5 basis points on the unutilized portion of the facility. The credit agreement, which contains a debt-to-total capitalization limitation and other customary covenants, expires on July 23, 2010. Principal payments of long-term debt for the twelve-month periods ending subsequent to September 30, 2010 are as follows: 2011 $

The 2014 Senior Notes mature in July 2014. Interest payments are required on a semi-annual basis. The 2014 Senior Notes were issued at a discount, yielding an effective interest rate of 3.784% at issuance. The debt discount is being amortized as interest expense through maturity. The Company may redeem the 2014 Senior Notes at any time at the applicable redemption price. Senior Notes due 2019: On July 28, 2009, the Company issued $500.0 million principal amount, 10-year, 4.875% unsecured Senior Notes (2019 Senior Notes). The 2019 Senior Notes mature in July 2019.

n effective interest rate of 5.039% at issuance. The debt discount is being amortized as interest expense through maturity. The Company may redeem the 2019 Senior Notes at any time at the applicable redemption price. Term loan due 2011: In December 2008, the Company entered into a 3-year, unsecured term loan (2011 Term Loan). The Company initially borrowed $360.0 million in December 2008 and borrowed an additional $180.0 million in January 2009, resulting in total original borrowings of $540.0 million under the 2011 Term Loan. As of October 3, 2009, the Company had total borrowings of $459.0 million under the 2011 Term Loan. The Company is required to make quarterly principal payments in the amount of 5% ($27.0 million) of the total original borrowings. These borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.0%, although the Company may elect the Prime Rate plus 1.0%. The interest rates are subject to adjustment in the event of a chan
ge in the Company’s credit ratings. Borrowings under the 2011 Term Loan incurred interest at weighted average interest rates of 2.1% and 2.3% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively. 1.02% Yen-denominated notes due 2010: In May 2003, the Company issued 7-year, 1.02% unsecured notes in Japan (Yen Notes) totaling 20.9 billion Yen (the equivalent of $231.6 million at October 3, 2009 and $230.1 million at January 3, 2009). Interest payments are required on a semi-annual basis and the entire principal balance is due in May 2010. The principal amount of the Yen Notes recorded on the balance sheet fluctuates based on the effects of foreign currency translation. Yen-denominated term loan due 2011: In December 2008, the Company entered into a 3-year, Yen-denominated unsecured term loan in Japan (Yen Term Loan) tot
aling 8.0 billion Japanese Yen (the equivalent of $88.8 million at October 3, 2009 and $88.2 million at January 3, 2009). The borrowings bear interest at the Yen LIBOR plus 2.0%. Interest payments are required on a semi-annual basis and the entire principal balance is due in December 2011. The principal amount of the Yen Term Loan recorded on the balance sheet fluctuates based on the effects of foreign currency translation. Credit Facility borrowings: In December 2006, the Company entered into a 5-year, $1.0 billion committed credit facility (Credit Facility) that it may draw on for general corporate purposes and to support its commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the United States Prime Rate (Prime Rate) or United States Dollar London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.235%, at the election of the Company. In the event that over half of the Credit Facility is drawn upon, an addit
ional five basis points is added to the elected Prime Rate or LIBOR rate. The interest rates are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the Company’s credit ratings. In October 2008, the Company borrowed $500.0 million under the Credit Facility to partially fund the retirement of the Company’s 1.22% Convertible Debentures in December 2008. In August 2009, the Company repaid the $500.0 million of Credit Facility borrowings with proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Senior Notes and 2019 Senior Notes. Accordingly, as of October 3, 2009 the Company has $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. In November 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract to convert $400.0 million of variable-rate borrowings under the Credit Facility into fixed-rate borrowings. The Company designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge under FASB ASC Topic 815. This contract terminated in February 2009 and payments made or received under this interest rate swap contract were recorded to interest expense. Inclusive of the interest rate swap, borrowings under the Credit Facility incurred interest at a weighted average interest rate of 0.5% and 1.0% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively. Commercial paper borrowings: The Company’s commercial paper program provides for the issuance of short-term, unsecured commercial paper with maturities up to 270 days. The Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of October 3, 2009. Any future commercial paper borrowings would bear interest at the applicable then-current market rates. The Company classifies all of its commercial paper borrowings as long-term debt, as the Company has the ability to repay any short-term maturity with available cash from its existing long-
term, committed Credit Facility. "

In October 2009, Windstream
received consent from its lenders to an amendment and restatement
of its senior secured credit facility (the
“Amendment”). See Note 15 for further discussion of the
financial impact of the Amendment. (b)
The Company has a revolving
line of credit in its senior secured credit facility under which it
may borrow up to $500.0 million less outstanding letters of credit.
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company repaid the full
amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit. The
revolving line of credit’s variable interest rates ranged
from 1.59 percent to 2.45 percent, with a weighted average rate of
1.77 percent during the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
After giving consideration to the Company’s letters of
credit, the Company had $491.8 million of available borrowing
capacity under the revolving line of credit as of
September 30, 2009. (c)
Certain of the
Company’s debentures and notes are callable by the Company at
various premiums on early redemption. (d)
The Company’s
collateralized Valor debt is equally and ratably secured with debt
under the senior secured credit facilities. Debt held by Windstream
Holdings of the Midwest, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, is
secured solely by the assets of the subsidiary. (e)
On October 8, 2009,
Windstream completed the private placement of approximately $400.0
million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due
November 1, 2017, (the “Private Placement”). See
Note 15 for further discussion of the financial impact of the
Private Placement. The terms of
the senior secured credit facilities and indentures include
customary covenants that, among other things, require Windstream to
maintain certain financial ratios, restrict its ability to incur
additional indebtedness, and limit its cash payments. These
financial ratios include a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5 to 1.0 and
a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75 to 1.0. In addition, the
covenants include restrictions on dividend and certain other types
of payments, as well as restrictions on capital expenditures. For
2009, the Company has capacity to spend $582.5 million, which
includes $132.5 million of unused capacity from 2008, under the
capital expenditures restriction in its covenants. In addition,
certain of the Company’s debt agreements contain various
covenants and restrictions specific to the subsidiary that is the
legal counterparty to the agreement. Under the Company’s
long-term debt agreements, acceleration of principal payments would
occur upon payment default, violation of debt covenants not cured
within 30 days, a change in control including a person or group
obtaining 50 percent or more of Windstream’s outstanding
voting stock, or breach of certain other
conditions set forth in the borrowing agreements. The Company was
in compliance with these covenants as of September 30,
2009. Maturities for
debt outstanding as of September 30, 2009 for each of the
twelve month periods ended September 30, 2010, 2011, 2012,
2013, and 2014 were $24.1 million, $307.3 million, $20.5 million,
$2,140.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively. See Note 15 for
the scheduled principal payments after giving effect to the Private
Placement and Amendment. Interest

entered into four identical pay fixed, receive variable interest
rate swap agreements totaling $1,600.0 million in notional value in
order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its variable
rate senior secured credit facilities. The four interest rate swap
agreements amortize quarterly to a notional value of $906.3 million
at maturity on July 17, 2013. The variable rate received
resets on the seventeenth day of each quarter to the three-month
LIBOR (London-Interbank Offered Rate). The Company’s interest
rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges of the
interest rate risk created by the variable interest rate paid on
Tranche B of the senior secured credit facilities through
July 17, 2013. The variable interest rate paid on Tranche B is
based on the three-month LIBOR, and it also resets on the
seventeenth day of each quarter. After the
completion of a refinancing transaction in February 2007, a portion
of one of the four interest rate swap agreements with a notional
value of $125.0 million ($98.4 million as of September 30,
2009) was de-designated as the corresponding hedged item was
repaid. Therefore, the undesignated portion of the swap agreement
was no longer an effective hedge of the variable interest rate paid
on Tranche B. Set forth below

agreements: (Millions, except for percentages) September 30,

% The
effectiveness of the Company’s cash flow hedges is assessed
each quarter using the “Change in Variable Cash Flow
Method”. This method utilizes the matched terms principle of
measuring effectiveness, and requires the floating-rate leg of the
swap and the hedged variable cash flows of the asset or liability
to be based on the same interest rate index. It also requires the
variable interest rates of both instruments to reset on the same
dates. Furthermore, there should be no other differences in the
terms of the hedge and the hedged item, and the likelihood of
default by the interest rate swap counterparties must be assessed
as being unlikely in order to conclude that there is no
ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship. The Company performs
and documents this assessment each quarter, and it concluded at
September 30, 2009 that there was no ineffectiveness to be
recognized in earnings for any of its four interest rate swap
agreements that are designated as hedges. In addition, the Company
has concluded that the Amendment of its debt agreements, described
in Note 15, will have no impact on its assessment of hedge
effectiveness. The Company
recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets as either assets or
liabilities depending on the rights or obligations under the
related contracts. Changes in fair value of these derivative
instruments were as follows for the three and nine month periods

Based on market prices, the fair value of the Company’s
long-term debt was $10.6 billion and $10.5 billion as of
October 24, 2009 and July 25, 2009, respectively.
Interest is payable semi-annually on each class of the senior
notes. Cash paid for interest for the three months ended
October 24, 2009 and October 25, 2008 was $269 million
and $165 million, respectively. The notes are redeemable by the
Company at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The Company
was in compliance with all debt covenants as of October 24,
2009.
(b) Credit
Facility
The Company has a credit
agreement with certain institutional lenders providing for a $2.9
billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to
expire on August 17, 2012.
Any advances under the
credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to,
based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the
Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% or Bank of America’s
“prime rate” as announced from time to time, or
(ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin
that is based on the Company’s senior debt credit ratings as
published by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. The credit agreement requires
that the Company comply with certain covenants including that it
maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the
agreement.
As of October 24,
2009, the Company was in compliance with the required interest
coverage ratio and the other covenants, and the Company had not
borrowed any funds under the credit facility. The Company may also,
upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or of
additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase
the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional
$2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit
facility up to August 15, 2014. "

4,2009-11-24,46640,XBRL," (12) Debt and Financing Arrangements On June 12, 2009, the Company entered into a three-year $175 million accounts receivable securitization program. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company sells, on a revolving basis, its receivables to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote-subsidiary. This subsidiary then sells all of the rights, title and interest in a pool of these receivables to an unaffiliated entity. After the sale, the Company, as servicer of the assets, collects the receivables on behalf of the unaffiliated entity. The amount of receivables sold through this program as of October 28, 2009 was $126.3 million. The proceeds from this securitization program are recognized on the statements of cash flows as a component of operating activities. On July 29, 2009, H. J. Heinz Finance Company (“HFC”), a subsidiary of Heinz, issued $250 million of 7.125% notes due 2039. The notes are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Company. The proceeds from the notes were used for payment of the cash component of the exchange transaction discussed below as well as various expenses relating to the exchange, and for general corporate purposes. On August 6, 2009, HFC issued $681 million of 7.125% notes due 2039 (of the same series as the notes issued in July 2009), and $217.5 million of cash, in exchange for $681 million of its outstanding 15.590% dealer remarketable securities due December 1, 2020. In addition, HFC terminated a portion of the remarketing option by paying the remarketing agent a cash payment of $89.0 million. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a modification of debt. Accordingly, cash payments used in the exchange, including the payment to the remarketing agent, have been accounted for as a reduction in the book value of the debt, and will be amortized to interest expense under the effective yield method. Additionally, the Company terminated its $175 million notional total rate of return swap in August 2009 in connection with the dealer remarketable securities exchange transaction. See Note 14 for additional information. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company entered into a three-year 15 billion Japanese yen denominated credit agreement (approximately $167 million). This credit agreement is yen LIBOR based and has been effectively converted to a U.S. dollar fixed rate facility using cross-currency interest rate swaps. See Note 14 for additional information. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of October 28, 2009. "
