A pro is that the logic employed closely matches standard GAAP Taxonomies and allows for a robust and systematic way of determining overall debt levels.  Indeed, using this approach I was able to get viable values for close to 90% of all 10-Q filings from 1994-2018.  \n",

    "**The disadvantage to this approach is that it can sometimes lead to apples-to-oranges type comparisons.  For instance, for a given 10-Q, the only short term debt field recovered may be a company's total current liabilities - either because the company provided little information or extraction faired poorly.  This value will likely overstate the company's short term debt (as it can include things like payroll and taxes).  For a different 10-Q, a more granular short-term debt field may be the only one resolved.  Under the scheme advanced, both values will appear as final short term debt levels.**  \n",
