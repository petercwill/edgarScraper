    "Results for each company are presented below and covered in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) plots for the extracted short term and long term debt across time are shown.  When a debt disclosure was extracted for the given quarter, the data point is highlighted in red.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) A data frame containing resolved debt fields is printed to console.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) A data frame containing the extracted disclosure is printed to console.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the tasks I did not have sufficent time to complete was building a topic-modeling algorithim to further process the debt-disclosures.  Gensim and nltk are python libraries that can support this kind of task, and aid in relavent passage extraction and summarization.  I think given more time this could be an interesting area of study.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, I want to mention that the task of extracting reliable debt levels from decades worth of filings that appear in multiple formats is a challenging one.  While, I think the applicable produced is a strong proof-of-concept, I want to be explicit about the possible sources of error and what could go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) There are errors, inconsistencies, and missing data in the edgar system of record.  Additionally, occasionally daily index files are served out as zipped tar files.  This is a corner case that I elected not to handle in the current design and as a result there are some gaps in the debt information extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The application can fail to extract any information from the filing.  This could be a result of the extraction strategies employed not being general enough to capture useful patterns of debt representation, or, it could be the result of a particular filer using particularly non-standard formating or reporting language.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Even when extraction succeeds, the raw results are further processed and resolved against standard gaap terms.  Occasionally, multiple extracted items will resolve to the same gaap field, and in this case, heuristics are used to select the \"best\" match.  It's likely that some useful extracted results are erronously filtered out during \"entity-linkage\" process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) After resolution, individual debt fields are populated and then aggregated into final short and long term debt numbers.  This process of \"rolling up\" subfields can again introduce error, especially if a piece of information has been incorrectly linked to a \"parent\" debt field.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Finally, as touched upon else where, there is a unit-inconsistency betweendifferent filing types, with HTML and TEXT filings more likely to report numbers in 1000s.  In the results that follow i've done my best to account for unit-scaling, however, this is really something that should be built into the extraction process itself."

      "Debt ObligationsConvertible Debt. In November 2014, Lexicon completed an offering of $87.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Notes”). The conversion feature did not meet the criteria for bifurcation as required by generally accepted accounting principles and the entire principal amount was recorded as long-term debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Notes are governed by an indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of November 26, 2014, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2015. The Notes mature on December 1, 2021. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date.

The debt issuance costs are amortized as interest expense over the expected life of the Notes using the effective interest method. The Company determined the expected life of the debt was equal to the seven-year term of the Notes. As of September 30, 2017, the balance of unamortized debt issuance costs was $2.0 million.The fair value of the Notes was $141.6 million as of September 30, 2017 and was determined using Level 2 inputs based on the indicative pricing published by certain investment banks or trading levels of the Notes, which are not listed on any securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer automated quotation system.Mortgage Loan.

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt In May 2009, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that provides for up to $4 million of equipment financing through October 2012 (the “2009 Loan Agreement”). Borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by equipment purchased with the proceeds of the loan and bear interest at a fixed rate of approximately 9%. The 2009 Loan Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including a financial covenant whereby the Company must maintain a minimum amount of liquidity measured at the end of each month where unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, is greater than $20 million plus outstanding debt due to SVB. In addition, the Company committed to a second loan and security agreement with SVB in August 2011 (the “2011 Loan Agreement”) in order to finance certain capital expenditures made by the Company in connection with its move in March 2012 to new office and laboratory space in Cranbury, New Jersey. The 2011 Loan Agreement provides for up to $3 million of equipment financing through January 2014. Borrowings under the 2011 Loan Agreement are collateralized by equipment purchased with the proceeds of the loan and bear interest at a variable rate of SVB prime + 2.5%. The current SVB prime rate is 4.0%. In February 2012, the Company borrowed approximately $1.0 million from the 2011 Loan Agreement which will be repaid over the following 2.5 years. The 2011 Loan Agreement contains the same financial covenant as the 2009 Loan Agreement. The Company has at all times been in compliance with these covenants during the term of both agreements. At March 31, 2012, the total amount due under the 2009 Loan Agreement and the 2011 Loan Agreement was $1.7 million. The carrying amount of the Company’s borrowings approximates fair value at March 31, 2012.\n",

The Company drew $15 million of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan at the end of December 2013 (the First Tranche) and may draw up to an additional $10 million through the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 (the Second Tranche). The principal outstanding balance of the First Tranche bears interest at a rate per annum fixed at 8.5%. If the Company draws from the Second Tranche, the principal outstanding balance of the Second Tranche will also have a fixed interest rate, which will be determined by reference to the applicable index rate at the time of the draw. The Company will make interest-only payments on the Term Loan beginning January 1, 2014 and continuing through April 1, 2015, after which the Company will repay the aggregate principal outstanding balance of the Term Loan in 33 equal monthly installments of principal, plus accrued interest at the applicable rate. The Term Loan matures on December 27, 2017. At June 30, 2014, the total principal amount due under the Term Loan was $15 million. In connection with the Term Loan, the Company recorded a debt discount of $0.8 million at December 31, 2013 which consists of payments to be made and a contingent payable to the lenders. These payments include a debt facility fee of $0.1 million which was paid on the date of the First Tranche, $0.4 million exit fee that will be payable upon repayment of the term loan and $0.3 million representing the fair value of a contingent payment of up to $0.4 million related to a success fee payable within six months of a trigger event, with the trigger event being regulatory acceptance of NDA or MMA submission. This is effective 5 years from the closing of the Term Loan. The success fee payable to the lender was probability adjusted and discounted utilizing an appropriate discount rate and is shown as a non-current liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The amortization of the debt discount is recorded as noncash interest expense over the life of the loan. For the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Company amortized the debt discount and the deferred financing using the effective interest method and recorded amortization expense of $43 thousand and $6 thousand, respectively, under operating expense on the consolidated statement of operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company amortized the debt discount and the deferred financing using the effective interest method and recorded amortization expense of $86 thousand and $12 thousand, respectively, under operating expense on the consolidated statement of operations. In August 2011, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the 2011 Loan Agreement) with SVB, in order to finance certain capital expenditures by the Company in connection with its move in March 2012 to new office and laboratory space in Cranbury, New Jersey. The 2011 Loan Agreement provided for up to $3 million of equipment financing through January 2014. Borrowings under the 2011 Loan Agreement were collateralized by equipment purchased with the proceeds of the loan and bear interest at a variable rate of SVB prime + 2.5%. The current SVB prime rate is 4.0%. In February 2012, the Company borrowed approximately $1.0 million from the 2011 Loan Agreement which will be repaid over the following 2.5 years. The 2011 Loan Agreement contains financial covenants and the Company has at all times been in compliance with these covenants. At June 30, 2014 the total amount due under the 2011 Loan Agreement was $0.1 million. The carrying amount of the Company’s borrowings approximates fair value at June 30, 2014.\n",

Interest is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2017. The Notes will mature on December 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, into cash, shares of the Company’s Common Stock or a combination thereof and may be settled as described below. The net proceeds from the Note Offering were $243.1 million, after deducting fees and estimated expenses payable by the Company. In addition, the Company used approximately $13.5 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions (“Capped Call Confirmations”) that the Company entered into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture dated December 21, 2016 (the “Indenture”) by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Convertible Notes are initially convertible into approximately 40,849,675 shares of the Company’s Common Stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 163.3987 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $6.12 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. Holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option at specified times prior to the maturity date of December 15, 2023, only if: · during any fiscal quarter commencing after March 31, 2017, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Common Stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is equal to or more than 130% of the conversion price of the Convertible Notes on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter; · a Holder submits its Convertible Notes for conversion during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the Convertible Notes, per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, for each such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s Common Stock and the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes on such date; · the Company issues to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Stock rights options or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 60 calendar days after the date of such issuance to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance or distributes to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock the Company’s assets, debt securities or rights to purchase the Company’s securities which distribution has a per share value of exceeding 10% of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such distribution · the Company enters into specified corporate transactions; or · the Company has had a call for redemption, the holder can convert up until the second trading day immediately preceding the redemption date The Convertible Notes will be convertible, at the option of the note holders, regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied, on or after September 15, 2023 at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date of December 15, 2023. Upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change or if the Company call all or any portion of the Convertible Notes for redemption prior to July 1, 2020, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the related redemption period. Upon conversion, the Company may pay cash, shares of the Company’s Common Stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company in its discretion. The Company accounts for the Convertible Notes as a liability and equity component where the carrying value of the liability component will be valued based on a similar instrument. In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. The equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components based on their relative values. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes. The difference between the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and the liability component represents the debt discount, which is recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the seven-year term of the Convertible Notes. The equity component of the Convertible Notes of approximately $88.3 million is included in additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $29.8 million in relation to the Convertible Notes. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $7.5 million, including approximately $6.9 million that was paid from the gross proceeds of the Convertible Notes offering. In accounting for the transaction costs, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the Convertible Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of the Convertible Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in additional-paid-in-capital. The Convertible Notes consist of the following (in thousands): as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016: Liability component March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Principal $ 250,000 $ 250,000 Less: debt discount (1) (88,546 ) (90,807 ) Less: deferred financing(1) (4,595 ) (4,729 ) Net carrying value of the debt $ 156,859 $ 154,464 (1)Included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Convertible Senior Notes (due 2023) and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the Convertible Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method.

The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Convertible Notes for the three months ended March 31, 2017: Components (In thousands) Contractual interest expense $ 1,887 Amortization of deferred financing 142 Amortization of debt discount 2,261 Total $ 4,290 Effective interest rate of the liability component 10.85 % The Capped Call Confirmations of $13.5 million are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Common Stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset the cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market price of the Common Stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Confirmations (which initially corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Confirmations), with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price of the Capped Call Confirmations. The Capped Call Confirmations have an initial cap price of $7.20 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 50% over the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on December 15, 2016, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Confirmations. The Capped Call Confirmations will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of shares of Common Stock that will underlie the Convertible Notes. The Capped Call Confirmations do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they are indexed to the Company’s Common Stock.

The last reported sale price of the Company’s Common Stock was equal to or more than 130% of the conversion price of the Convertible Notes for at least 20 trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the second quarter. As a result, the Convertible Notes are currently convertible into the Company’s Common stock as discussed above. Upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change or if the Company call all or any portion of the Convertible Notes for redemption prior to July 1, 2020, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the related redemption period. Upon conversion, the Company may pay cash, shares of the Company’s Common Stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company in its discretion. The Company accounts for the Convertible Notes as a liability and equity component where the carrying value of the liability component will be valued based on a similar instrument. In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. The equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components based on their relative values. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes. The difference between the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and the liability component represents the debt discount, which is recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the seven-year term of the Convertible Notes. The equity component of the Convertible Notes of approximately $88.3 million is included in additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $29.8 million in relation to the Convertible Notes. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $7.5 million, including approximately $6.9 million that was paid from the gross proceeds of the Convertible Notes offering. In accounting for the transaction costs, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the Convertible Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of the Convertible Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in additional-paid-in-capital. The Convertible Notes consist of the following (in thousands): as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016: Liability component September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Principal $ 250,000 $ 250,000 Less: debt discount (1) (83,972 ) (90,807 ) Less: deferred financing(1) (4,393 ) (4,729 ) Net carrying value of the debt $ 161,635 $ 154,464 (1) Included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Convertible Senior Notes (due 2023) and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the Convertible Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. The fair value of the debt at September 30, 2017 was approximately $644.0 million. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Convertible Notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017: Components (In thousands) Three Months endedSeptember 30, 2017 Nine Months endedSeptember 30, 2017 Contractual interest expense $ 1,887 $ 5,641 Amortization of debt discount 2,342 6,835 Amortization of deferred financing 122 344 Total $ 4,351 $ 12,820 Effective interest rate of the liability component was 10.85%. The Capped Call Confirmations of $13.5 million are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Common Stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset the cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market price of the Common Stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Confirmations (which initially corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Confirmations), with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price of the Capped Call Confirmations. The Capped Call Confirmations have an initial cap price of $7.20 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 50% over the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on December 15, 2016, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Confirmations. The Capped Call Confirmations will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of shares of Common Stock that will underlie the Convertible Notes. The Capped Call Confirmations do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they are indexed to the Company’s Common Stock. The premiums paid for the Capped Call Confirmations have been included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital. \n",

      " Note 5. Debt Convertible Notes due 2023 In December 2016, the Company issued at par value $250 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Convertible Notes”), which included the exercise in full of the $25 million over-allotment option granted to the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes, in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act (the “Note Offering”). Interest is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2017. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms. The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holders, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof. The net proceeds from the Note Offering were $243.0 million, after deducting fees and estimated expenses payable by the Company. In addition, the Company used approximately $13.5 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions (“Capped Call Confirmations”) that the Company entered into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes. In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components based on their relative values. The Convertible Notes are initially convertible into approximately 40,849,675 shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 163.3987 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $6.12 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock was equal to or more than 130% of the conversion price of the Convertible Notes for at least 20 trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the second quarter. As a result, the Convertible Notes are currently convertible into the Company’s common stock. As further described in “—Note 6. Stockholders’ Equity,” on February 15, 2018, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement relating to an underwritten public offering of 19,354,839 shares of the Company’s common stock. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, the Company granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days after February 16, 2018, to purchase up to an additional 2,903,225 shares of the Company’s common stock, which was exercised with respect to 885,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Subsequent to the underwritten public offering on February 15, 2018, the Company did not have sufficient unissued authorized shares to cover a conversion of the Convertible Notes. As a result, the Company accounted for the portion of the bifurcated conversion feature and of the Capped Call Confirmations that would not be able to be net share settled as a current derivative liability and as a derivative asset, respectively. The fair value of the derivative liability for the conversion feature and derivative asset for the Capped Call Confirmations at February 15, 2018 was determined to be $507.4 million and $13.6 million, respectively, of which the portion that was determined to not be able to be net share settled was recorded with a corresponding impact to additional-paid-in-capital. Subsequent changes to fair value of the derivatives were recorded through earnings on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations resulting in a change in fair value of derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $4.9 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company recorded the fair value of the derivative liability of $80.6 million as a current liability and the fair value of the Capped Call Confirmation of $2.2 million as a current asset within Other Current Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

      "Debt Senior Secured Term Loan due 2023 In September 2018, the Company entered into a loan agreement with BioPharma Credit PLC as the lender. The loan agreement provides for a $150 million senior secured term loan (“Senior Secured Term Loan”) with an interest rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR plus 7.50% per annum and matures five years from the maturity date. The Senior Secured Term Loan will be repaid in four quarterly payments equal to 12.50% thereof starting on the forty-eight month anniversary of the date of the first credit extension with the balance due on the Maturity Date. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The Senior Secured Term Loan contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default applicable to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, but does not include any financial covenants relating to the achievement or maintenance of revenue or cash flow. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lender may declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan to be immediately due and payable.

Senior Unsecured NotesDuring August 2014, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Senior Notes”) due August 15, 2019. In connection with this offering, we received net proceeds of $246.9 million, after deducting the related underwriting discounts and commissions and issuance costs. Interest on the Senior Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2015. The Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our secured indebtedness (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness) and structurally subordinated to all liabilities and preferred equity of our subsidiaries.The Senior Notes will mature on August 15, 2019, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased. Holders may exchange their Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 15, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter beginning after September 30, 2014 (and only during such quarter) if the closing sale price of our Class A common stock is more than 130% of the then current exchange price for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter; (ii) during the five consecutive business-day period following any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Senior Notes for each trading day during such five trading-day period was less than 98% of the closing sale price of our Class A common stock, for each trading day during such five trading-day period multiplied by the then current exchange rate; (iii) if we call any or all of the Senior Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions (significant consolidation, sale, merger, share exchange, fundamental change, etc.). The if-converted value of the Senior Notes did not exceed their principal at September 30, 2014 and as such has no effect on our earnings per share.On or after May 15, 2019, and on or prior to the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may exchange their notes without regard to the foregoing conditions.The Senior Notes will be exchangeable into cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election. We have asserted it is our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the Senior Notes in cash. The initial exchange rate of Senior Notes is 51.4059 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $19.45 per share of Class A common stock), subject to adjustment, as described in the related indenture governing the Senior Notes. Following certain corporate transactions which constitute a make-whole fundamental change (defined in the indenture), we will increase the exchange rate for holders who elect to exchange their Senior Notes in connection with such make whole fundamental change in certain circumstances. Following certain corporate transactions which constitute a fundamental change, holders may require us to repurchase the Senior Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.We have separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Senior Notes by bifurcating gross proceeds between the indebtedness, or liability component, and the embedded conversion option, or the equity component. The bifurcation was done by estimating an effective interest rate as of the date of the issuance for similar notes which do not contain an embedded conversion option. This effective interest rate was estimated to be 3.8% and was used to compute the fair value at the time of issuance for the indebtedness of $236.6 million. The gross proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes less the initial amount allocated to the indebtedness resulted in a $13.4 million allocation to the embedded conversion option which has been reflected in the Equity, net of financing costs, in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2014. The resulting debt discount is being amortized over the five year period in which the Senior Notes are expected to be outstanding (that is, through maturity date) as additional non-cash interest expense. As of September 30, 2014, the unamortized discount was $13.1 million. The additional non-cash interest expense attributable to the Senior Notes will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the maturity date as the Senior Notes accrete to their par value over the same period.Underwriting discounts and commissions and issuance costs totaled $3.1 million and were allocated to the indebtedness and the embedded conversion option on a pro-rata basis and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively. In this connection, $2.9 million attributable to the indebtedness was recorded as part of Deferred Costs, to be subsequently amortized using the effective interest method as interest expense over the expected term of the Senior Notes, and $0.2 million attributable to the embedded conversion option was recorded as a reduction to Equity in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2014.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, total interest expense related to the Senior Notes was $1.3 million consisting of (i) the contractual interest expense of $0.9 million, (ii) the additional non-cash interest expense of $0.3 million related to the accretion of the debt discount, and (iii) the amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million related to the Senior Notes.\n",

The term of the line of credit ends in October 2017. Mortgages The Company has mortgages secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France. These mortgages had an outstanding balance of $3.0 million and $3.6 million at March 29, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively, and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. Bank Term Debt In addition to the senior secured revolving credit facility discussed above, the credit agreement entered into on October 4, 2012 also provided for an aggregate credit commitment to Tornier USA of $115.0 million, consisting of: (1) a senior secured term loan facility to Tornier USA denominated in dollars in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75.0 million (USD term facility); and (2) a senior secured term loan facility to Tornier USA denominated in Euros in an aggregate principal amount of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $40.0 million. The borrowings under the term loan facilities were used to pay the cash purchase consideration for the OrthoHelix acquisition, and fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the credit agreement and to repay prior existing indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries. On March 13, 2015, Tornier USA entered into an incremental term facility amendment. Under terms of the amendment, the senior secured term loan facility denominated in U.S. Dollars available to Tornier was increased by an additional aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million with the amortization schedule revised to reflect the additional term loan advance. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The amendment provides for no other changes to covenants or events of default under the credit facility, and provides for no change to any guaranty or collateral relating to the credit agreement. The term loans mature in October 2017. In the second quarter of 2013, the $40.0 million senior secured term loan facility denominated in Euros was repaid in full. As part of the repayment, the Company recorded a $1.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of the corresponding deferred financing costs.

      "68,105 Line of Credit On October 4, 2012, the Company, and one of its U.S. operating subsidiaries, Tornier, Inc. (Tornier USA), entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, SG Americas Securities, LLC, as Syndication Agent, BMO Capital Markets and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and SG Americas Securities, LLC, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, and the other lenders party thereto. The credit facility included a senior secured revolving credit facility to Tornier USA denominated at the election of Tornier USA, in U.S. dollars, Euros, pounds sterling, and yen in an aggregate principal amount of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $30.0 million. Funds available under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Loans under the revolving credit facility bore interest at (a) the alternate base rate (if denominated in U.S. dollars), equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%, and (iii) the adjusted LIBO rate plus 1%, plus in the case of each of (i)-(iii) above, an applicable rate of 2.00% or 2.25% (depending on the Company’s total net leverage ratio as defined in its credit agreement), or (b) in the case of a Eurocurrency loan (as defined in the credit agreement), at the applicable adjusted LIBO rate for the relevant interest period plus an applicable rate of 3.00% or 3.25% (depending on the Company’s total net leverage ratio), plus the mandatory cost (as defined in the credit agreement) if such loan is made in a currency other than U.S. dollars or from a lending office in the United Kingdom or a participating member state (as defined in the credit agreement). Additionally, the Company was subject to a 0.5% interest rate related to the unfunded balance on the line of credit. As of September 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, the outstanding balance related to this line of credit was $7.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. The term of the line of credit was scheduled to end in October 2017. On October 1, 2015, in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Company terminated all commitments and repaid all outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement, including without limitation the outstanding balance under the line of credit. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Mortgages The Company has mortgages secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France. These mortgages had an outstanding balance of $2.6 million and $3.6 million at September 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively, and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. Bank Term Debt In addition to the senior secured revolving credit facility discussed above, the credit agreement entered into on October 4, 2012 also provided for an aggregate credit commitment to Tornier USA of $115.0 million, consisting of: (1) a senior secured term loan facility to Tornier USA denominated in U.S. dollars in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75.0 million (USD term facility); and (2) a senior secured term loan facility to Tornier USA denominated in Euros in an aggregate principal amount of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $40.0 million. The senior secured term loan facility denominated in Euros was repaid in full during 2013. The borrowings under the term loan facilities were used to pay the cash purchase consideration for the OrthoHelix acquisition, and fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the credit agreement and to repay prior existing indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries. On March 13, 2015, Tornier USA entered into an incremental term facility amendment. Under terms of the amendment, the senior secured term loan facility denominated in U.S. dollars available to Tornier was increased by an additional aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million with the amortization schedule revised to reflect the additional term loan advance. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The amendment provided for no other changes to covenants or events of default under the credit facility, and provided for no change to any guaranty or collateral relating to the credit agreement. The term loans were scheduled to mature in October 2017. On October 1, 2015, in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Company terminated all commitments and repaid all outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement, including without limitation the outstanding term loans. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Borrowings under these term debt facilities within the credit agreement as of September 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014 were as follows: September 27, 2015 December 28, 2014 Senior secured U.S dollar term loan $\n",

The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the Conversion Rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to an initial conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the indenture relating to the 2020 Notes. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2020 Notes, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2020 Notes. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes. For the three months ended March 27, 2016 and March 31, 2015, we recorded $6.5 million and $3 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): March 27, 2016 December 27, 2015Principal amount of 2020 Notes$632,500 $632,500Unamortized debt discount(121,411) (127,953)Unamortized debt issuance costs(14,747) (15,541)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes1$496,342 $489,006 1 The prior period debt issuance costs were reclassified to account for adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 (See Note 2).The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $564 million at March 27, 2016, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with the Option Counterparties. See Note 6 for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture), (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the Option Counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges and warrants, (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions, (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the Option Counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges and warrant transactions at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges or increase WMG's obligations under the warrant transactions. In addition, the Option Counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes, (ii) a change in law that adversely impacts the Option Counterparties’ ability to hedge their positions in the 2020 Note Hedges and warrants or (iii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer for more than 10% of our ordinary shares or that may have a material economic effect on the warrant transactions. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges or increase WMG's obligations under the warrant transactions. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $145 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the Option Counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are net-share settled and are exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. Aside from the initial payment of the $145 million premium to the Option Counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the Option Counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the Option Counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any day during the 200 trading day measurement period under the warrant transaction, we will be obligated to issue to the Option Counterparties a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are then convertible at or following maturity. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee. The 2017 Notes mature on August 15, 2017, and we pay interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG may not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represents an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. The holder of the 2017 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. While we currently do not expect significant conversions because the notes currently trade at a premium to the as-converted value, and a converting holder would forego future interest payments, any conversions would reduce our cash resources. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the indenture relating to the 2017 Notes. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2017 Notes, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2017 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2017 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2017 Notes. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will pay a cash make-whole premium by increasing the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2017 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2017 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of this transaction, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three months ended March 27, 2016 and March 31, 2015, we recorded $0.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount, respectively, based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within \"Other expense (income), net\" in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and March 27, 2016, $60 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes remained outstanding and is included within long-term obligations on the consolidated balance sheet.The components of the 2017 Notes were as follows (in thousands): March 27, 2016 December 27, 2015Principal amount of 2017 Notes$60,000 $60,000Unamortized debt discount(2,981) (3,495)Unamortized debt issuance costs(545) (640)Net carrying amount of 2017 Notes1$56,474 $55,865 1 The prior period debt issuance costs were reclassified to account for adoption of ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 (See Note 2).The estimated fair value of the 2017 Notes was approximately $59 million at March 27, 2016, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).Mortgages and Shareholder Debt The mortgages acquired as a result of the Wright/Tornier merger are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France. Mortgages and other debt had an outstanding balance of $3.5 million and $2.7 million at March 27, 2016 and December 27, 2015 and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%.The shareholder debt is the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term. The outstanding balance on this debt was $1.9 million as of March 27, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\n",

The 2021 Notes will pay interest at an annual rate of 2.25% semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on November 15, 2016, and will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2021 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2021 Notes will be 46.8165 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.36 per ordinary share. We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2021 Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2021 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at any time prior to May 15, 2021 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2021 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the indenture relating to the 2021 Notes. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2021 Notes, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2021 Notes. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, we, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2021 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2021 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of this transaction, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $7.3 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2021 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2021 Notes was $117.2 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes. For the three months ended June 26, 2016, we recorded $1.4 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 9.72%.The components of the 2021 Notes were as follows (in thousands): June 26, 2016 December 27, 2015Principal amount of 2021 Notes$395,000 $—Unamortized debt discount(115,860) —Unamortized debt issuance costs(7,235) —Net carrying amount of 2021 Notes$271,905 $—The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately $397 million at June 26, 2016, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We entered into 2021 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes with two counterparties. The 2021 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that we would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2021 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2021 Notes indenture), (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2021 Note Hedges, (iii) our failure to perform certain obligations under the 2021 Notes indenture or under the 2021 Notes Hedges, (iv) certain payment defaults on our existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million or (v) if we or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2021 Notes, or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2021 Notes Hedges was $99.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Hedges and the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of 18.5 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment, for an aggregate of $54.6 million. The strike price of the warrants is $30.00 per share, which was 69% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on May 12, 2016. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 100 trading day period beginning on February 15, 2022. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $99.8 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2021 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2021 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2021 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2021 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes.2020 NotesOn February 13, 2015, WMG issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 13, 2015 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the conversion rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to an initial conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the indenture relating to the 2020 Notes. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2020 Notes, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2020 Notes. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2020 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes. For the three and six months ended June 26, 2016, we recorded $6.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded $6.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $990.00 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes and the rounded amount. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $9.3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016. As of June 26, 2016 and December 27, 2015, $587.5 million and $632.5 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes remained outstanding and is included within long-term obligations on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): June 26, 2016 December 27, 2015Principal amount of 2020 Notes$587,500 $632,500Unamortized debt discount(106,567) (127,953)Unamortized debt issuance costs(12,944) (15,541)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes1$467,989 $489,006 1 The prior period debt issuance costs were reclassified to account for adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 (See Note 2).The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $530 million at June 26, 2016, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with three option counterparties. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture), (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges, (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges, (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner and/or adjust the terms of the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes, or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $145 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the three option counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for 21.1 million Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.During the three months ended June 26, 2016, we settled a portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges (receiving $3.9 million) and repurchased warrants for an aggregate of 1.5 million ordinary shares (paying $3.3 million) associated with the 2020 Notes.Aside from the initial payment of the $145 million premium in the aggregate to the option counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one half of one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2017 Notes mature on August 15, 2017, and we pay interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG may not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represents an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. Holders may convert their 2017 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. While we currently do not expect significant conversions because the 2017 Notes currently trade at a premium to the as-converted value, and a converting holder would forego future interest payments, any conversions would reduce our cash resources. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the indenture relating to the 2017 Notes. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2017 Notes, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2017 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2017 Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2017 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the indenture relating to the 2017 Notes. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will pay a cash make-whole premium by increasing the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2017 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2017 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of this transaction, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three and six months ended June 26, 2016, we recorded $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount, respectively, based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded $0.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount, respectively, based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the six months ended June 30, 2015. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes exchanged approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount their 2017 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,035.40 principal amount of 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and the rounded amount. In addition, during the three months ended June 26, 2016, we repurchased and extinguished an additional $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. As a result of this exchange and these repurchases, we recognized approximately $3.0 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016. As of June 26, 2016 and December 27, 2015, $2.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes remained outstanding and is included within long-term obligations on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The components of the 2017 Notes were as follows (in thousands): June 26, 2016 December 27, 2015Principal amount of 2017 Notes$2,026 $60,000Unamortized debt discount(84) (3,495)Unamortized debt issuance costs(14) (640)Net carrying amount of 2017 Notes1$1,928 $55,865 1 The prior period debt issuance costs were reclassified to account for adoption of ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 (See Note 2).The estimated fair value of the 2017 Notes was approximately $2 million at June 26, 2016, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).Mortgages and Shareholder Debt The mortgages acquired as a result of the Wright/Tornier merger are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France. Mortgages and other debt had an outstanding balance of $3.1 million and $2.7 million at June 26, 2016 and December 27, 2015 and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%.The shareholder debt is the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term. The outstanding balance on this debt was $2.0 million as of June 26, 2016 and December 27, 2015.\n",

      "Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease ObligationsLong-term debt and capital lease obligations consist of the following (in thousands): September 25, 2016 December 27, 2015Capital lease obligations$14,919 $13,763 2021 Notes276,580 —2020 Notes 1475,100 489,0062017 Notes 11,94955,865 Mortgages/other3,008 2,740Shareholder debt1,894 1,998 773,450 563,372Less: current portion(4,117) (2,171) $769,333 $561,201 1 The prior period debt issuance costs were reclassified to account for adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 (See Note 2).2021 NotesOn May 20, 2016, we issued $395 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2021 Notes Indenture), dated as of May 20, 2016, between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2021 Notes will pay interest at an annual rate of 2.25% semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on November 15, 2016, and will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2021 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2021 Notes will be 46.8165 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2021 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2021 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.36 per ordinary share. We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2021 Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2021 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at any time prior to May 15, 2021 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2021 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2021 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, we, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2021 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2021 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of this transaction, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $7.3 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2021 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2021 Notes was $117.2 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 25, 2016, we recorded $4.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 9.72%.The components of the 2021 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 25, 2016 December 27, 2015Principal amount of 2021 Notes$395,000 $—Unamortized debt discount(111,702) —Unamortized debt issuance costs(6,718) —Net carrying amount of 2021 Notes$276,580 $—The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately $498.2 million at September 25, 2016, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We entered into 2021 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes with two counterparties. The 2021 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that we would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2021 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture), (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2021 Note Hedges, (iii) our failure to perform certain obligations under the 2021 Notes Indenture or under the 2021 Notes Hedges, (iv) certain payment defaults on our existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million or (v) if we or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2021 Notes, or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2021 Notes Hedges was $99.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Hedges and the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of 18.5 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment, for an aggregate of $54.6 million. The strike price of the warrants is $30.00 per share, which was 69% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on May 12, 2016. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 100 trading day period beginning on February 15, 2022. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $99.8 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2021 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2021 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2021 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2021 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes.2020 NotesOn February 13, 2015, WMG issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2020 Notes Indenture), dated as of February 13, 2015 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the conversion rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to an initial conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $29.94 per ordinary share (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2020 Notes Indenture. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2020 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 25, 2016, we recorded $6.3 million and $19.4 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded $6.1 million and $15.4 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $990.00 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes and the rounded amount. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $9.3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the nine months ended September 25, 2016. The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 25, 2016 December 27, 2015Principal amount of 2020 Notes$587,500 $632,500Unamortized debt discount(100,226) (127,953)Unamortized debt issuance costs(12,174) (15,541)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes1$475,100 $489,006 1 The prior period debt issuance costs were reclassified to account for adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 (See Note 2).The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $629.0 million at September 25, 2016, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with three option counterparties. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture), (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges, (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes Indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges, (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner and/or adjust the terms of the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes, or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $144.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the three option counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for 21.1 million Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.During the three months ended June 26, 2016, we settled a portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges (receiving $3.9 million) and repurchased warrants for an aggregate of 1.5 million ordinary shares (paying $3.3 million) associated with the 2020 Notes.Aside from the initial payment of the $144.8 million premium in the aggregate to the option counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one half of one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2017 Notes Indenture), dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2017 Notes mature on August 15, 2017, and we pay interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG may not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represents an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. Holders may convert their 2017 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. While we currently do not expect significant conversions because the 2017 Notes currently trade at a premium to the as-converted value, and a converting holder would forego future interest payments, any conversions would reduce our cash resources. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2017 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2017 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2017 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2017 Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2017 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2017 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will pay a cash make-whole premium by increasing the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2017 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2017 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of this transaction, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 25, 2016, we recorded $18 thousand and $918 thousand, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount, respectively, based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. For the three and nine ended September 30, 2015, we recorded $0.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount, respectively, based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes exchanged approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount their 2017 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,035.40 principal amount of 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and the rounded amount. In addition, during the three months ended June 26, 2016, we repurchased and extinguished an additional $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. As a result of this exchange and these repurchases, we recognized approximately $3.0 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the nine months ended September 25, 2016.The components of the 2017 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 25, 2016 December 27, 2015Principal amount of 2017 Notes$2,026 $60,000Unamortized debt discount(66) (3,495)Unamortized debt issuance costs(11) (640)Net carrying amount of 2017 Notes1$1,949 $55,865 1 The prior period debt issuance costs were reclassified to account for adoption of ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 (See Note 2).The estimated fair value of the 2017 Notes was approximately $2.1 million at September 25, 2016, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).Mortgages and Shareholder Debt The Company has mortgages and other debt that had an outstanding balance of $3.0 million and $2.7 million at September 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015. The majority of this debt is mortgages that were acquired as a result of the Wright/Tornier merger. These mortgages are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. The shareholder debt is the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term. The outstanding balance on this debt was $1.9 million and $2.0 million as of September 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively.\n",

      "Debt and Capital Lease ObligationsDebt and capital lease obligations consist of the following (in thousands): March 26, 2017 December 25, 2016Capital lease obligations$15,682 $14,892 2021 Notes285,448 280,8112020 Notes 489,783 482,3642017 Notes 1,9931,971Asset-based line of credit17,424 30,000Mortgages2,486 2,544Shareholder debt1,759 1,773 814,575 814,355Less: Current portion(21,697) (33,948) 2021 Notes(285,448) — $507,430 $780,4072021 NotesOn May 20, 2016, we issued $395 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2021 Notes Indenture), dated as of May 20, 2016, between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2021 Notes require interest to be paid at an annual rate of 2.25% semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, and will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2021 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2021 Notes will be 46.8165 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2021 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2021 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.36 per ordinary share. We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2021 Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2021 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at any time prior to May 15, 2021 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2021 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2021 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, we, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2021 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2021 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $7.3 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method.As of March 26, 2017, the closing price of our ordinary shares was greater than 130% of the 2021 Notes conversion price for 20 or more of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-end; and, therefore, the holders of the 2021 Notes may convert the notes during the succeeding quarterly period. Due to the ability of the holders of the 2021 Notes to convert the notes during this period, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative were classified as current liabilities, and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Hedges were classified as current assets as of March 26, 2017. The respective balances were classified as long-term as of December 25, 2016. We currently do not expect significant conversions because the 2021 Notes currently trade at a premium to the as-converted value, and a converting holder would forego future interest payments. However, any conversions would reduce our cash resources. We believe that, in the event that holders elect to exercise the conversion option, our cash resources and access to additional borrowings would provide the necessary liquidity. The 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2021 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2021 Notes was $117.2 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes. For the three months ended March 26, 2017, we recorded $4.4 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 9.72%.The components of the 2021 Notes were as follows (in thousands): March 26, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2021 Notes$395,000 $395,000Unamortized debt discount(103,077) (107,441)Unamortized debt issuance costs(6,475) (6,748)Net carrying amount of 2021 Notes$285,448 $280,811The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately $614.9 million at March 26, 2017, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We entered into 2021 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes with two counterparties. The 2021 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that we would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2021 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2021 Note Hedges; (iii) our failure to perform certain obligations under the 2021 Notes Indenture or under the 2021 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on our existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if we or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2021 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2021 Notes Hedges was $99.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Hedges and the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of 18.5 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment, for an aggregate of $54.6 million. The strike price of the warrants is $30.00 per share, which was 69% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on May 12, 2016. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 100 trading day period beginning on February 15, 2022. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $99.8 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2021 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2021 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2021 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2021 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes.2020 NotesOn February 13, 2015, WMG issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2020 Notes Indenture), dated as of February 13, 2015 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes were initially issued whereby they were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the conversion rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to a conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $29.94 per ordinary share (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2020 Notes Indenture. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18.1 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2020 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes. For the three months ended March 26, 2017 and March 27, 2016, we recorded $6.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $990.00 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes and the rounded amount. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $9.3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016. The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): March 26, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2020 Notes$587,500 $587,500Unamortized debt discount(87,133) (93,749)Unamortized debt issuance costs(10,584) (11,387)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes$489,783 $482,364The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $705.1 million at March 26, 2017, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with three option counterparties. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges; (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes Indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner and/or adjust the terms of the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $144.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the three option counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for 21.1 million Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.In addition, during the second quarter of 2016, we settled a portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges (receiving $3.9 million) and repurchased a portion of the warrants associated with the 2020 Notes (paying $3.3 million), generating net proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. Subsequent to this partial settlement, we had warrants which were exercisable for 19.6 million ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants remained $38.8010 per ordinary share. Aside from the initial payment of the $144.8 million premium in the aggregate to the option counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one half of one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2017 Notes Indenture), dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2017 Notes mature on August 15, 2017, and we pay interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG may not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represents an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. Holders could have converted their 2017 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. While we currently do not expect significant conversions because the 2017 Notes currently trade at a premium to the as-converted value, and a converting holder would forego future interest payments, any conversions would reduce our cash resources. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2017 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2017 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2017 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2017 Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2017 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2017 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will pay a cash make-whole premium by increasing the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2017 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2017 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2017 Notes, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three months ended March 27, 2016, we recorded $0.5 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. The amount of interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount for the three months ended March 26, 2017 was insignificant.In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes exchanged approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount their 2017 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,035.40 principal amount of 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and the rounded amount. In addition, during the three months ended June 26, 2016, we repurchased and extinguished an additional $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. As a result of this exchange and these repurchases, we recognized approximately $3.0 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other income, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016.The components of the 2017 Notes were as follows (in thousands): March 26, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2017 Notes$2,026 $2,026Unamortized debt discount(28) (47)Unamortized debt issuance costs(5) (8)Net carrying amount of 2017 Notes$1,993 $1,971The estimated fair value of the 2017 Notes was approximately $2.1 million at March 26, 2017, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).ABL FacilityOn December 23, 2016, we, together with WMG and certain of our other wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, Borrowers), entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (ABL Credit Agreement) with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent (Agent) and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a $150.0 million senior secured asset-based line of credit, subject to the satisfaction of a borrowing base requirement (ABL Facility). The ABL Facility may be increased by up to $100.0 million upon the Borrowers’ request, subject to the consent of the Agent and each of the other lenders providing such increase. All borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default, the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects and the delivery of an updated borrowing base certificate. As of March 26, 2017 and December 25, 2016, we had $17.4 million and $30.0 million, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. We have reflected this debt as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 26, 2017 and December 25, 2016, as required by US GAAP due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the agreement, as well as the ability for the lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt under certain circumstances as described below. As of March 26, 2017 and December 25, 2016, we had $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the ABL Facility. These amounts are included within \"Other assets\" on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Facility as described below.The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the ABL Facility is, at the option of the Borrowers, equal to either (a) 3.25% for base rate loans or (b) 4.25% for LIBOR rate loans, subject to a 0.75% LIBOR floor. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility, the Borrowers also are required to pay a customary unused line fee equal to 0.50% per annum in respect of unutilized commitments and certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the ABL Facility. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Borrowers are required to maintain a minimum drawn balance on the ABL Facility equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for each month. To the extent the actual drawn balance is less than 20%, the Borrowers must pay a fee equal to the amount the lenders under the ABL Facility would have earned had the Borrowers maintained a minimum drawn balance equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for such month. The ABL Credit Agreement requires that the Borrowers calculate the borrowing base for the ABL Facility on at least a monthly basis and each time the Borrowers make a draw on the ABL Facility in accordance with the formula set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. The borrowing base is subject to adjustment and the implementation of reserves by the Agent in its permitted discretion, as further described in the ABL Credit Agreement. If at any time the outstanding drawn balance under the ABL Facility exceeds the borrowing base as in effect at such time, Borrowers will be required to prepay loans under the ABL Facility in an amount equal to such excess. Certain accounts receivables and proceeds of collateral of the Borrowers will be applied to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the ABL Facility on a periodic basis. There is no scheduled amortization under the ABL Facility and (subject to borrowing base requirements and applicable conditions to borrowing) the available revolving commitment may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed without restriction. All outstanding loans under the ABL Facility will be due and payable in full on the date that is the earliest to occur of (x) December 23, 2021; (y) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2020 Notes or; (z) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2021 Notes, provided that, the springing maturity under clauses (y) and (z) are subject to the Borrowers’ ability to refinance, extend, renew or replace the 2020 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes, as applicable, in full pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement. Any voluntary or mandatory permanent reduction or termination of the revolving commitments under the ABL Facility is subject to a prepayment premium applicable to such reduced or terminated amount equal to (i) 3.0% through December 23, 2017, (ii) 2.0% from December 24, 2017 through December 23, 2018 and (iii) 0.75% at any time thereafter. The ABL Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions as specified in the ABL Credit Agreement and an affirmative covenant that we maintain net revenue at or above minimum levels and maintain liquidity in the United States at a level specified in the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. All of the obligations under the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by Wright Medical Group N.V. and each of the Borrowers on the terms set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of Wright Medical Group N.V. and each Borrower. As of March 26, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement.Mortgages and Shareholder Debt We have mortgages that had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million at March 26, 2017 and December 25, 2016. The majority of this debt is mortgages that were acquired as a result of the Wright/Tornier merger. These mortgages are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. The shareholder debt acquired was the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term. The outstanding balance on this debt was $1.8 million as of March 26, 2017 and December 25, 2016.\n",

The 2021 Notes require interest to be paid at an annual rate of 2.25% semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, and will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2021 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2021 Notes will be 46.8165 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2021 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2021 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.36 per ordinary share. We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2021 Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2021 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at any time prior to May 15, 2021 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2021 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2021 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, we, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2021 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2021 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $7.3 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method.In the first quarter of 2017, the closing price of our ordinary shares was greater than 130% of the 2021 Notes conversion price for 20 or more of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-end; and, therefore, the holders of the 2021 Notes had the ability to convert the notes during the succeeding quarterly period. Due to the ability of the holders of the 2021 Notes to convert the notes during this period, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative were classified as current liabilities, and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Hedges were classified as current assets as of March 26, 2017. There were no conversions during the second quarter of 2017. The closing price of our ordinary shares was less than 130% of the 2021 Notes conversion price for more than 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter ended June 25, 2017, which resulted in the 2021 Notes no longer being convertible. As such, the 2021 Notes, 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative and 2021 Notes Hedges were classified as long-term as of June 25, 2017. The 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2021 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2021 Notes was $117.2 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes. For the three and six months ended June 25, 2017, we recorded $4.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 9.72%.The components of the 2021 Notes were as follows (in thousands): June 25, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2021 Notes$395,000 $395,000Unamortized debt discount(98,606) (107,441)Unamortized debt issuance costs(6,196) (6,748)Net carrying amount of 2021 Notes$290,198 $280,811The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately $543.0 million at June 25, 2017, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We entered into 2021 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes with two counterparties. The 2021 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that we would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2021 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2021 Note Hedges; (iii) our failure to perform certain obligations under the 2021 Notes Indenture or under the 2021 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on our existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if we or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2021 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2021 Notes Hedges was $99.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Hedges and the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of 18.5 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment, for an aggregate of $54.6 million. The strike price of the warrants is $30.00 per share, which was 69% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on May 12, 2016. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 100 trading day period beginning on February 15, 2022. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $99.8 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2021 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2021 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2021 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2021 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes.2020 NotesOn February 13, 2015, WMG issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2020 Notes Indenture), dated as of February 13, 2015 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes were initially issued whereby they were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the conversion rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to a conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $29.94 per ordinary share (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2020 Notes Indenture. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18.1 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2020 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes. For the three and six months ended June 25, 2017, we recorded $6.8 million and $13.4 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54% For the three and six months ended June 26, 2016, we recorded $6.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $990.00 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes and the rounded amount. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $9.3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016. The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): June 25, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2020 Notes$587,500 $587,500Unamortized debt discount(80,374) (93,749)Unamortized debt issuance costs(9,762) (11,387)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes$497,364 $482,364The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $646.3 million at June 25, 2017, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with three option counterparties. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges; (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes Indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner and/or adjust the terms of the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $144.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the three option counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for 21.1 million Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.In addition, during the second quarter of 2016, we settled a portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges (receiving $3.9 million) and repurchased a portion of the warrants associated with the 2020 Notes (paying $3.3 million), generating net proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. Subsequent to this partial settlement, we had warrants which were exercisable for 19.6 million ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants remained $38.8010 per ordinary share. Aside from the initial payment of the $144.8 million premium in the aggregate to the option counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one half of one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2017 Notes Indenture), dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2017 Notes mature on August 15, 2017, and we pay interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG may not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represents an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. Holders could have converted their 2017 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. While we currently do not expect significant conversions because the 2017 Notes currently trade at a premium to the as-converted value, and a converting holder would forego future interest payments, any conversions would reduce our cash resources. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2017 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2017 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2017 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2017 Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2017 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2017 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will pay a cash make-whole premium by increasing the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2017 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2017 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2017 Notes, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three and six months ended June 26, 2016, we recorded $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. The amount of interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount for the three and six months ended June 25, 2017 was insignificant.In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes exchanged approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount their 2017 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,035.40 principal amount of 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and the rounded amount. In addition, during the three months ended June 26, 2016, we repurchased and extinguished an additional $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. As a result of this exchange and these repurchases, we recognized approximately $3.0 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016.The components of the 2017 Notes were as follows (in thousands): June 25, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2017 Notes$2,026 $2,026Unamortized debt discount(9) (47)Unamortized debt issuance costs(2) (8)Net carrying amount of 2017 Notes$2,015 $1,971The estimated fair value of the 2017 Notes was approximately $2.1 million at June 25, 2017, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).ABL FacilityOn December 23, 2016, we, together with WMG and certain of our other wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, Borrowers), entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (ABL Credit Agreement) with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent (Agent) and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a $150.0 million senior secured asset-based line of credit, subject to the satisfaction of a borrowing base requirement (ABL Facility). The ABL Facility may be increased by up to $100.0 million upon the Borrowers’ request, subject to the consent of the Agent and each of the other lenders providing such increase. All borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default, the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects and the delivery of an updated borrowing base certificate. As of June 25, 2017 and December 25, 2016, we had $21.1 million and $30.0 million, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. We have reflected this debt as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 25, 2017 and December 25, 2016, as required by US GAAP due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the agreement, as well as the ability for the lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt under certain circumstances as described below. As of June 25, 2017 and December 25, 2016, we had $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the ABL Facility. These amounts are included within \"Other assets\" on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Facility as described below.The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the ABL Facility is, at the option of the Borrowers, equal to either (a) 3.25% for base rate loans or (b) 4.25% for LIBOR rate loans, subject to a 0.75% LIBOR floor. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility, the Borrowers also are required to pay a customary unused line fee equal to 0.50% per annum in respect of unutilized commitments and certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the ABL Facility. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Borrowers are required to maintain a minimum drawn balance on the ABL Facility equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for each month. To the extent the actual drawn balance is less than 20%, the Borrowers must pay a fee equal to the amount the lenders under the ABL Facility would have earned had the Borrowers maintained a minimum drawn balance equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for such month. The ABL Credit Agreement requires that the Borrowers calculate the borrowing base for the ABL Facility on at least a monthly basis and each time the Borrowers make a draw on the ABL Facility in accordance with the formula set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. The borrowing base is subject to adjustment and the implementation of reserves by the Agent in its permitted discretion, as further described in the ABL Credit Agreement. If at any time the outstanding drawn balance under the ABL Facility exceeds the borrowing base as in effect at such time, Borrowers will be required to prepay loans under the ABL Facility in an amount equal to such excess. Certain accounts receivables and proceeds of collateral of the Borrowers will be applied to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the ABL Facility on a periodic basis. There is no scheduled amortization under the ABL Facility and (subject to borrowing base requirements and applicable conditions to borrowing) the available revolving commitment may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed without restriction. All outstanding loans under the ABL Facility will be due and payable in full on the date that is the earliest to occur of (x) December 23, 2021; (y) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2020 Notes or (z) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2021 Notes; provided that, the springing maturity under clauses (y) and (z) are subject to the Borrowers’ ability to refinance, extend, renew or replace the 2020 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes, as applicable, in full pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement. Any voluntary or mandatory permanent reduction or termination of the revolving commitments under the ABL Facility is subject to a prepayment premium applicable to such reduced or terminated amount equal to (i) 3.0% through December 23, 2017, (ii) 2.0% from December 24, 2017 through December 23, 2018 and (iii) 0.75% at any time thereafter. The ABL Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions as specified in the ABL Credit Agreement and an affirmative covenant that we maintain net revenue at or above minimum levels and maintain liquidity in the United States at a level specified in the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. All of the obligations under the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by Wright Medical Group N.V. and each of the Borrowers on the terms set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of Wright Medical Group N.V. and each Borrower. As of June 25, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement.Mortgages and Shareholder Debt We have mortgages that had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million at June 25, 2017 and December 25, 2016. The majority of this debt is mortgages that were acquired as a result of the Wright/Tornier merger. These mortgages are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. The shareholder debt acquired was the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term. The outstanding balance on this debt was $1.7 million as of June 25, 2017 and $1.8 million as of December 25, 2016.\n",

The 2021 Notes require interest to be paid at an annual rate of 2.25% semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, and will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2021 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2021 Notes will be 46.8165 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2021 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2021 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.36 per ordinary share. We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2021 Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2021 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at any time prior to May 15, 2021 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2021 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2021 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, we, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2021 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2021 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $7.3 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method.In the first quarter of 2017, the closing price of our ordinary shares was greater than 130% of the 2021 Notes conversion price for 20 or more of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-end; and, therefore, the holders of the 2021 Notes had the ability to convert the notes during the succeeding quarterly period. Due to the ability of the holders of the 2021 Notes to convert the notes during this period, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative were classified as current liabilities, and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Hedges were classified as current assets as of March 26, 2017. There were no conversions during the second quarter of 2017. The closing price of our ordinary shares was less than 130% of the 2021 Notes conversion price for more than 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the calendar quarters ended June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, which resulted in the 2021 Notes no longer being convertible. As such, the 2021 Notes, 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative and 2021 Notes Hedges were classified as long-term as of September 24, 2017. The 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2021 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2021 Notes was $117.2 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017, we recorded $4.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 9.72%. For the three and nine months ended September 25, 2016, we recorded $4.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 9.72%. The components of the 2021 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 24, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2021 Notes$395,000 $395,000Unamortized debt discount(94,025) (107,441)Unamortized debt issuance costs(5,910) (6,748)Net carrying amount of 2021 Notes$295,065 $280,811The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately $528.4 million at September 24, 2017, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We entered into 2021 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes with two counterparties. The 2021 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that we would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2021 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2021 Note Hedges; (iii) our failure to perform certain obligations under the 2021 Notes Indenture or under the 2021 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on our existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if we or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2021 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2021 Notes Hedges was $99.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Hedges and the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of 18.5 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment, for an aggregate of $54.6 million. The strike price of the warrants is $30.00 per share, which was 69% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on May 12, 2016. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 100 trading day period beginning on February 15, 2022. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $99.8 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2021 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2021 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2021 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2021 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes.2020 NotesOn February 13, 2015, WMG issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2020 Notes Indenture), dated as of February 13, 2015 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes were initially issued whereby they were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the conversion rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to a conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $29.94 per ordinary share (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2020 Notes Indenture. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18.1 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2020 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017, we recorded $6.9 million and $20.3 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. For the three and nine months ended September 25, 2016, we recorded $6.3 million and $19.4 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $990.00 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes and the rounded amount. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $9.3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other expense (income), net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016. The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 24, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2020 Notes$587,500 $587,500Unamortized debt discount(73,470) (93,749)Unamortized debt issuance costs(8,924) (11,387)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes$505,106 $482,364The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $632.4 million at September 24, 2017, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with three option counterparties. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges; (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes Indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner and/or adjust the terms of the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $144.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the three option counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for 21.1 million Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.In addition, during the second quarter of 2016, we settled a portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges (receiving $3.9 million) and repurchased a portion of the warrants associated with the 2020 Notes (paying $3.3 million), generating net proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. Subsequent to this partial settlement, we had warrants which were exercisable for 19.6 million ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants remained $38.8010 per ordinary share. Aside from the initial payment of the $144.8 million premium in the aggregate to the option counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one half of one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2017 Notes Indenture), dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2017 Notes matured on August 15, 2017. Prior to maturity, we paid interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG could not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” was available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG was not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represented an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. Holders could have converted their 2017 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders could convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. The 2017 Notes were senior unsecured obligations that ranked: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2017 Notes, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which were amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative required bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and was accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 25, 2016, we recorded $18.0 thousand and $0.9 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. The amount of interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017 was insignificant.In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other expense (income), net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes exchanged approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount their 2017 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,035.40 principal amount of 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and the rounded amount. In addition, during the three months ended June 26, 2016, we repurchased and extinguished an additional $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. As a result of this exchange and these repurchases, we recognized approximately $3.0 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other expense (income), net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016.The components of the 2017 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 24, 2017 December 25, 2016Principal amount of 2017 Notes$— $2,026Unamortized debt discount— (47)Unamortized debt issuance costs— (8)Net carrying amount of 2017 Notes$— $1,971ABL FacilityOn December 23, 2016, we, together with WMG and certain of our other wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, Borrowers), entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (ABL Credit Agreement) with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent (Agent) and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a $150.0 million senior secured asset-based line of credit, subject to the satisfaction of a borrowing base requirement (ABL Facility). The ABL Facility may be increased by up to $100.0 million upon the Borrowers’ request, subject to the consent of the Agent and each of the other lenders providing such increase. All borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default, the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects and the delivery of an updated borrowing base certificate. As of September 24, 2017 and December 25, 2016, we had $53.9 million and $30.0 million, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. We have reflected this debt as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 24, 2017 and December 25, 2016, as required by US GAAP due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the agreement, as well as the ability for the lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt under certain circumstances as described below. As of September 24, 2017 and December 25, 2016, we had $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the ABL Facility. These amounts are included within \"Other assets\" on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Facility as described below.The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the ABL Facility is, at the option of the Borrowers, equal to either (a) 3.25% for base rate loans or (b) 4.25% for LIBOR rate loans, subject to a 0.75% LIBOR floor. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility, the Borrowers also are required to pay a customary unused line fee equal to 0.50% per annum in respect of unutilized commitments and certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the ABL Facility. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Borrowers are required to maintain a minimum drawn balance on the ABL Facility equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for each month. To the extent the actual drawn balance is less than 20%, the Borrowers must pay a fee equal to the amount the lenders under the ABL Facility would have earned had the Borrowers maintained a minimum drawn balance equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for such month. The ABL Credit Agreement requires that the Borrowers calculate the borrowing base for the ABL Facility on at least a monthly basis and each time the Borrowers make a draw on the ABL Facility in accordance with the formula set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. The borrowing base is subject to adjustment and the implementation of reserves by the Agent in its permitted discretion, as further described in the ABL Credit Agreement. If at any time the outstanding drawn balance under the ABL Facility exceeds the borrowing base as in effect at such time, Borrowers will be required to prepay loans under the ABL Facility in an amount equal to such excess. Certain accounts receivables and proceeds of collateral of the Borrowers will be applied to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the ABL Facility on a periodic basis. There is no scheduled amortization under the ABL Facility and (subject to borrowing base requirements and applicable conditions to borrowing) the available revolving commitment may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed without restriction. All outstanding loans under the ABL Facility will be due and payable in full on the date that is the earliest to occur of (x) December 23, 2021; (y) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2020 Notes or (z) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2021 Notes; provided that, the springing maturity under clauses (y) and (z) are subject to the Borrowers’ ability to refinance, extend, renew or replace the 2020 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes, as applicable, in full pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement. Any voluntary or mandatory permanent reduction or termination of the revolving commitments under the ABL Facility is subject to a prepayment premium applicable to such reduced or terminated amount equal to (i) 3.0% through December 23, 2017, (ii) 2.0% from December 24, 2017 through December 23, 2018 and (iii) 0.75% at any time thereafter. The ABL Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions as specified in the ABL Credit Agreement and an affirmative covenant that we maintain net revenue at or above minimum levels and maintain liquidity in the United States at a level specified in the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. All of the obligations under the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by Wright Medical Group N.V. and each of the Borrowers on the terms set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of Wright Medical Group N.V. and each Borrower. As of September 24, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement.Mortgages and Shareholder Debt We have mortgages that had an outstanding balance of $2.6 million and $2.5 million as of September 24, 2017 and December 25, 2016, respectively. The majority of this debt is mortgages that were acquired as a result of the Wright/Tornier merger. These mortgages are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. The shareholder debt acquired was the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term. The outstanding balance on this debt was $1.7 million as of September 24, 2017 and $1.8 million as of December 25, 2016.\n",

The 2021 Notes require interest to be paid at an annual rate of 2.25% semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, and will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2021 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2021 Notes will be 46.8165 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2021 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2021 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.36 per ordinary share. We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2021 Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2021 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at any time prior to May 15, 2021 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2021 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2021 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, we, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2021 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2021 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $7.3 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method.In the first quarter of 2017, the closing price of our ordinary shares was greater than 130% of the 2021 Notes conversion price for 20 or more of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-end; and, therefore, the holders of the 2021 Notes had the ability to convert the notes during the succeeding quarterly period. Due to the ability of the holders of the 2021 Notes to convert the notes during this period, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative were classified as current liabilities, and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Hedges were classified as current assets as of March 26, 2017. There were no conversions during the second quarter of 2017. The closing price of our ordinary shares was less than 130% of the 2021 Notes conversion price for more than 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the calendar quarters ended June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017 and April 1, 2018, which resulted in the 2021 Notes no longer being convertible. As such, the 2021 Notes, 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative and 2021 Notes Hedges were classified as long-term as of April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2021 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2021 Notes was $117.2 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes. For the three months ended April 1, 2018 and March 26, 2017, we recorded $4.8 million and $4.4 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 9.72%. The components of the 2021 Notes were as follows (in thousands): April 1, 2018 December 31, 2017Principal amount of 2021 Notes$395,000 $395,000Unamortized debt discount(84,523) (89,332)Unamortized debt issuance costs(5,317) (5,617)Net carrying amount of 2021 Notes$305,160 $300,051The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately $448.9 million at April 1, 2018, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We entered into 2021 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes with two counterparties. The 2021 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that we would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2021 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2021 Note Hedges; (iii) our failure to perform certain obligations under the 2021 Notes Indenture or under the 2021 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on our existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if we or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2021 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2021 Notes Hedges was $99.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Hedges and the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of 18.5 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment, for an aggregate of $54.6 million. The strike price of the warrants is $30.00 per share, which was 69% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on May 12, 2016. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 100 trading day period beginning on February 15, 2022. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $99.8 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2021 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2021 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2021 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2021 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes.2020 NotesOn February 13, 2015, WMG issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2020 Notes Indenture), dated as of February 13, 2015 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes were initially issued whereby they were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the conversion rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to a conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $29.94 per ordinary share (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2020 Notes Indenture. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18.1 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2020 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes. For the three months ended April 1, 2018 and March 26, 2017, we recorded $7.2 million and $6.6 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $990.00 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes and the rounded amount. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $9.3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016. The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): April 1, 2018 December 31, 2017Principal amount of 2020 Notes$587,500 $587,500Unamortized debt discount(59,213) (66,418)Unamortized debt issuance costs(7,192) (8,068)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes$521,095 $513,014The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $587.4 million at April 1, 2018, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with three option counterparties. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges; (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes Indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner and/or adjust the terms of the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $144.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the three option counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for 21.1 million Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.In addition, during the second quarter of 2016, we settled a portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges (receiving $3.9 million) and repurchased a portion of the warrants associated with the 2020 Notes (paying $3.3 million), generating net proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. Subsequent to this partial settlement, we had warrants which were exercisable for 19.6 million ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants remained $38.8010 per ordinary share. Aside from the initial payment of the $144.8 million premium in the aggregate to the option counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one half of one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2017 Notes Indenture), dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2017 Notes matured on August 15, 2017. Prior to maturity, we paid interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG could not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” was available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG was not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represented an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. Holders could have converted their 2017 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders could convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. The 2017 Notes were senior unsecured obligations that ranked: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2017 Notes, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which were amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative required bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and was accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three months ended March 26, 2017, we recorded $0.5 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 6.47%. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes exchanged approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount their 2017 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,035.40 principal amount of 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and the rounded amount. In addition, during the three months ended June 26, 2016, we repurchased and extinguished an additional $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. As a result of this exchange and these repurchases, we recognized approximately $3.0 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016.ABL FacilityOn December 23, 2016, we, together with WMG and certain of our other wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, Borrowers), entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (ABL Credit Agreement) with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent (Agent) and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a $150.0 million senior secured asset-based line of credit, subject to the satisfaction of a borrowing base requirement (ABL Facility). The ABL Facility may be increased by up to $100.0 million upon the Borrowers’ request, subject to the consent of the Agent and each of the other lenders providing such increase. All borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default, the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects and the delivery of an updated borrowing base certificate. As of April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $53.0 million and $53.6 million respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. We have reflected this debt as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, as required by US GAAP due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the agreement, as well as the ability for the lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt under certain circumstances as described below. As of April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $2.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the ABL Facility. These amounts are included within \"Other assets\" on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Facility as described below.The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the ABL Facility is, at the option of the Borrowers, equal to either (a) 3.25% for base rate loans or (b) 4.25% for LIBOR rate loans, subject to a 0.75% LIBOR floor. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility, the Borrowers also are required to pay a customary unused line fee equal to 0.50% per annum in respect of unutilized commitments and certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the ABL Facility. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Borrowers are required to maintain a minimum drawn balance on the ABL Facility equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for each month. To the extent the actual drawn balance is less than 20%, the Borrowers must pay a fee equal to the amount the lenders under the ABL Facility would have earned had the Borrowers maintained a minimum drawn balance equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for such month. The ABL Credit Agreement requires that the Borrowers calculate the borrowing base for the ABL Facility on at least a monthly basis and each time the Borrowers make a draw on the ABL Facility in accordance with the formula set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. The borrowing base is subject to adjustment and the implementation of reserves by the Agent in its permitted discretion, as further described in the ABL Credit Agreement. If at any time the outstanding drawn balance under the ABL Facility exceeds the borrowing base as in effect at such time, Borrowers will be required to prepay loans under the ABL Facility in an amount equal to such excess. Certain accounts receivables and proceeds of collateral of the Borrowers will be applied to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the ABL Facility on a periodic basis. There is no scheduled amortization under the ABL Facility and (subject to borrowing base requirements and applicable conditions to borrowing) the available revolving commitment may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed without restriction. All outstanding loans under the ABL Facility will be due and payable in full on the date that is the earliest to occur of (x) December 23, 2021; (y) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2020 Notes or (z) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2021 Notes; provided that, the springing maturity under clauses (y) and (z) are subject to the Borrowers’ ability to refinance, extend, renew or replace the 2020 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes, as applicable, in full pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement. Any voluntary or mandatory permanent reduction or termination of the revolving commitments under the ABL Facility is subject to a prepayment premium applicable to such reduced or terminated amount equal to (i) 3.0% through December 23, 2017, (ii) 2.0% from December 24, 2017 through December 23, 2018 and (iii) 0.75% at any time thereafter. The ABL Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions as specified in the ABL Credit Agreement and an affirmative covenant that we maintain net revenue at or above minimum levels and maintain liquidity in the United States at a level specified in the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. All of the obligations under the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by Wright Medical Group N.V. and each of the Borrowers on the terms set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of Wright Medical Group N.V. and each Borrower. On May 7, 2018, we amended and restated the ABL Credit Agreement to add a $40.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan Facility). The initial $20.0 million term loan tranche was funded at closing. The Company may at any time borrow the second $20.0 million term loan tranche, but will be required to do so no later than May 7, 2019 unless it meets certain adjusted EBITDA targets; in which case, the Company will be permitted to extend the borrowing requirement for up to an additional 2 years. All borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default and the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects.The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will be equal to one-month LIBOR plus 7.85%, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. Amortization payments under the Term Loan Facility are due in equal monthly installments beginning on May 1, 2019 unless the Company meets certain adjusted EBITDA targets; in which case, the amortization payments would not commence until May 1, 2021. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility, the Borrowers will also be required to pay certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the Term Loan Facility.The Term Loan Facility requires mandatory prepayments, subject to the right of reinvestment and certain other exceptions, in amounts equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and casualty and condemnation events in excess of $10 million in any fiscal year. Any voluntary or mandatory prepayment under the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain exceptions, is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium. The advances under the Term Loan Facility will be due and payable in full at the same time as the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility. All of the obligations under the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by the Company and each of the Borrowers and are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of the Company and each Borrower on the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement. In addition to financial and liquidity covenants consistent with those in the ABL Credit Agreement, while the Term Loan Facility is outstanding, the Company is required to maintain a minimum adjusted EBITDA, as described in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement will not affect the Company’s ability to meet its existing contractual obligations, including payments under the Borrower Representative’s contingent value rights agreement, except in circumstances where an event of default (subject to certain exceptions) has occurred and is continuing. The Credit Agreement also contains negative covenants, representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, in each case subject to grace periods, thresholds and materiality qualifiers consistent with the ABL Credit Agreement. Other Debt Other debt primarily includes mortgages, shareholder debt and loans acquired as a result of the IMASCAP acquisition. We have mortgages that had an outstanding balance of $0.9 million and $1.0 million at April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These mortgages are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. As a result of the IMASCAP acquisition, we have two zero interest loans with a state investment company that had an outstanding balance of $1.2 million at April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We also had shareholder debt outstanding of $1.6 million as of April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The remainder of other debt totaled approximately $5.8 million and $4.2 million as of April 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The shareholder debt was acquired in conjunction with the Wright/Tornier merger. This debt was the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term.\n",

The 2023 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us on a senior unsecured basis. The Notes are referred to as \"exchangeable\" in the 2023 Notes Indenture because they were issued by WMG, not us. The 2023 Notes require interest to be paid at an annual rate of 1.625% semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15 and will mature on June 15, 2023 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2023 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2023 Notes is 29.9679 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2023 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2023 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $33.37 per ordinary share. WMG may not redeem the 2023 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2023 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2023 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2022 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2023 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after December 15, 2022 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2023 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2023 Notes Indenture. If a fundamental change, as defined in the 2023 Notes Indenture, occurs, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2023 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2023 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2023 Notes Indenture. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the 2023 Notes Indenture, that occurs prior to the maturity date, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2023 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Our guarantee of the 2023 Notes is our senior unsecured obligation that ranks: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the guarantee; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $12.4 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2023 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2023 Notes Exchange Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2023 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2023 Notes Exchange Derivative. The fair value of the 2023 Notes Exchange Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2023 Notes was $124.6 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2023 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2023 Notes. For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, we recorded $0.2 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount. The components of the 2023 Notes were as follows (in thousands): July 1, 2018Principal amount of 2023 Notes$675,000Unamortized debt discount(124,411)Unamortized debt issuance costs(12,284)Net carrying amount of 2023 Notes$538,305The estimated fair value of the 2023 Notes was approximately $673.8 million at July 1, 2018, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We and WMG entered into 2023 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes with two counterparties. The 2023 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2023 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change; (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2023 Note Hedges; (iii) our or WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2023 Notes Indenture or under the 2023 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain defaults on our, WMG's or any our other subsidiary's indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if we, WMG or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2023 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2023 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2023 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2023 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2023 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2023 Notes Hedges was $141.3 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2023 Notes Hedges and the 2023 Notes Exchange Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants that are initially exercisable into 20.2 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, for an aggregate of $102.1 million. The strike price of the warrants is $40.86 per share, which was 50% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on June 20, 2018. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 120 trading day period beginning on September 15, 2023. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $141.3 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2023 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2023 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2023 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2023 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2023 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2023 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2023 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2023 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2020 Notes for the 2023 Notes.2021 NotesOn May 20, 2016, we issued $395 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2021 Notes Indenture), dated as of May 20, 2016, between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2021 Notes require interest to be paid at an annual rate of 2.25% semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15 and will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2021 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2021 Notes will be 46.8165 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2021 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2021 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.36 per ordinary share. We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2021 Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2021 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at any time prior to May 15, 2021 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2021 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2021 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, we, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2021 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2021 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $7.3 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2021 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2021 Notes was $117.2 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes using an effective rate of 9.72%. For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, we recorded $4.9 million and $9.7 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount. For the three and six months ended June 25, 2017, we recorded $4.5 million and $8.8 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount.The components of the 2021 Notes were as follows (in thousands): July 1, 2018 December 31, 2017Principal amount of 2021 Notes$395,000 $395,000Unamortized debt discount(79,598) (89,332)Unamortized debt issuance costs(4,970) (5,617)Net carrying amount of 2021 Notes$310,432 $300,051The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately $529.3 million at July 1, 2018, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We entered into 2021 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes with two counterparties.

Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2021 Notes Hedges was $99.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Hedges and the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of 18.5 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment, for an aggregate of $54.6 million. The strike price of the warrants is $30.00 per share, which was 69% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on May 12, 2016. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 100 trading day period beginning on February 15, 2022. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $99.8 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2021 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period.

We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes.2020 NotesOn February 13, 2015, WMG issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2020 Notes Indenture), dated as of February 13, 2015 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes were initially issued whereby they were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the conversion rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to a conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $29.94 per ordinary share (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2020 Notes Indenture. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18.1 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2020 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, we recorded $7.1 million and $14.3 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount. For the three and six months ended June 25, 2017, we recorded $6.8 million and $13.4 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount.Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $45 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $990.00 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes and the rounded amount. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $45 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $9.3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount.Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2023 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $400.9 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2023 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,138.70 principal amount of the 2023 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Notes for each exchanging investor, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $400.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $39.9 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended July 1, 2018. The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): July 1, 2018 December 31, 2017Principal amount of 2020 Notes$186,589 $587,500Unamortized debt discount(16,469) (66,418)Unamortized debt issuance costs(2,000) (8,068)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes$168,120 $513,014The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $202 million at July 1, 2018, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with three option counterparties. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges; (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes Indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner and/or adjust the terms of the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $144.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the three option counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for 21.1 million Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.During the second quarter of 2016, we settled a portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges (receiving $3.9 million) and repurchased a portion of the warrants associated with the 2020 Notes (paying $3.3 million), generating net proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. During the second quarter of 2018, we agreed to settle a pro rata portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges and agreed to repurchase a pro rata portion of the warrants associated with the 2020 Notes. The pricing of these 2020 Notes Hedges and warrants associated with the 2020 Notes were based on pricing between July 9, 2018 and July 27, 2018 and were settled on July 30, 2018. As a result of these settlements, we received net proceeds of approximately $10.6 million on July 30, 2018. As we had agreed to settle a portion of the warrants in cash prior to July 1, 2018, we had warrants which were exercisable for 6.2 million ordinary shares with a strike price of $38.8010 per ordinary share as of July 1, 2018. The warrants which we had agreed to settle as of July 1, 2018 are recorded as a current derivative liability as of July 1, 2018 as described within Note 6. Aside from the initial payment of the $144.8 million premium in the aggregate to the option counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one half of one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2017 Notes Indenture), dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2017 Notes matured on August 15, 2017. Prior to maturity, we paid interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG could not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” was available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG was not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represented an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. Holders could have converted their 2017 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders could convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. The 2017 Notes were senior unsecured obligations that ranked: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2017 Notes, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which were amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative required bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and was accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount was amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three and six months ended June 25, 2017, interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 6.47% was negligible. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes exchanged approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount their 2017 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,035.40 principal amount of 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and the rounded amount. In addition, during the three months ended June 26, 2016, we repurchased and extinguished an additional $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. As a result of this exchange and these repurchases, we recognized approximately $3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016.ABL FacilityOn December 23, 2016, we, together with WMG and certain of our other wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, Borrowers), entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (ABL Credit Agreement) with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent (Agent) and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a $150 million senior secured asset-based line of credit, subject to the satisfaction of a borrowing base requirement (ABL Facility). The ABL Facility may be increased by up to $100 million upon the Borrowers’ request, subject to the consent of the Agent and each of the other lenders providing such increase. All borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default, the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects and the delivery of an updated borrowing base certificate. As of July 1, 2018, and December 31, 2017, we had $32.5 million and $53.6 million respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. We have reflected this debt as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, as required by US GAAP due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the agreement, as well as the ability for the lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt under certain circumstances as described below. As of July 1, 2018, and December 31, 2017, we had $2.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the ABL Facility. These amounts are included within \"Other assets\" on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Facility as described below.The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the ABL Facility is, at the option of the Borrowers, equal to either (a) 3.25% for base rate loans or (b) 4.25% for LIBOR rate loans, subject to a 0.75% LIBOR floor. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility, the Borrowers also are required to pay a customary unused line fee equal to 0.50% per annum in respect of unutilized commitments and certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the ABL Facility. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Borrowers are required to maintain a minimum drawn balance on the ABL Facility equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for each month. To the extent the actual drawn balance is less than 20%, the Borrowers must pay a fee equal to the amount the lenders under the ABL Facility would have earned had the Borrowers maintained a minimum drawn balance equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for such month. The ABL Credit Agreement requires that the Borrowers calculate the borrowing base for the ABL Facility on at least a monthly basis and each time the Borrowers make a draw on the ABL Facility in accordance with the formula set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. The borrowing base is subject to adjustment and the implementation of reserves by the Agent in its permitted discretion, as further described in the ABL Credit Agreement. If at any time the outstanding drawn balance under the ABL Facility exceeds the borrowing base as in effect at such time, Borrowers will be required to prepay loans under the ABL Facility in an amount equal to such excess. Certain accounts receivables and proceeds of collateral of the Borrowers will be applied to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the ABL Facility on a periodic basis. There is no scheduled amortization under the ABL Facility and (subject to borrowing base requirements and applicable conditions to borrowing) the available revolving commitment may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed without restriction. All outstanding loans under the ABL Facility will be due and payable in full on the date that is the earliest to occur of (x) December 23, 2021; (y) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2020 Notes or (z) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2021 Notes; provided that, the springing maturity under clauses (y) and (z) are subject to the Borrowers’ ability to refinance, extend, renew or replace the 2020 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes, as applicable, in full pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement. Any voluntary or mandatory permanent reduction or termination of the revolving commitments under the ABL Facility is subject to a prepayment premium applicable to such reduced or terminated amount equal to (i) 3.0% through December 23, 2017, (ii) 2.0% from December 24, 2017 through December 23, 2018 and (iii) 0.75% at any time thereafter. The ABL Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions as specified in the ABL Credit Agreement and an affirmative covenant that we maintain net revenue at or above minimum levels and maintain liquidity in the United States at a level specified in the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. All of the obligations under the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by Wright Medical Group N.V. and each of the Borrowers on the terms set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of Wright Medical Group N.V. and each Borrower. On May 7, 2018, we amended and restated the ABL Credit Agreement to add a $40 million term loan facility (Term Loan Facility). The initial $20 million term loan tranche was funded at closing. The Borrowers may at any time borrow the second $20 million term loan tranche, but will be required to do so no later than May 7, 2019 unless certain adjusted EBITDA targets are met; in which case, the Borrowers will be permitted to extend the borrowing requirement for up to an additional two years. All borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default and the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects. As of July 1, 2018, we had $20 million of the term loan outstanding.The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will be equal to one-month LIBOR plus 7.85%, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. Amortization payments under the Term Loan Facility are due in equal monthly installments beginning on May 1, 2019 unless we meet certain adjusted EBITDA targets; in which case, the amortization payments would not commence until May 1, 2021. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility, the Borrowers will also be required to pay certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the Term Loan Facility.The Term Loan Facility requires mandatory prepayments, subject to the right of reinvestment and certain other exceptions, in amounts equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and casualty and condemnation events in excess of $10 million in any fiscal year. Any voluntary or mandatory prepayment under the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain exceptions, is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium. The advances under the Term Loan Facility will be due and payable in full at the same time as the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility. As a result of the Term Loan Facility, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $1 million, which will be amortized over the three-year term using the effective interest method.All of the obligations under the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by us and each of the Borrowers and are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of us and each Borrower on the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement. In addition to financial and liquidity covenants consistent with those in the ABL Credit Agreement, while the Term Loan Facility is outstanding, the Company is required to maintain a minimum adjusted EBITDA, as described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The ABL Credit Agreement will not affect our ability to meet our existing contractual obligations, including payments under the Borrower Representative’s contingent value rights agreement, except in circumstances where an event of default (subject to certain exceptions) has occurred and is continuing. The ABL Credit Agreement also contains negative covenants, representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, in each case subject to grace periods, thresholds and materiality qualifiers consistent with the ABL Credit Agreement. Other Debt Other debt primarily includes mortgages, shareholder debt and loans acquired as a result of the IMASCAP acquisition. We have mortgages that had an outstanding balance of $0.7 million and $1.0 million at July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These mortgages are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. As a result of the IMASCAP acquisition, we have two zero interest loans with a state investment company that had an outstanding balance of $1.1 million and $1.2 million at July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We also had shareholder debt outstanding of $1.5 million and $1.6 million as of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The remainder of other debt totaled approximately $6.6 million and $4.2 million as of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The shareholder debt was acquired in conjunction with the Wright/Tornier merger. This debt was the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term.\n",

Due to the ability of the holders of the 2021 Notes to convert the notes during this period, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes were classified as current liabilities as of September 30, 2018. The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash upon satisfaction of certain circumstances as described below. On or after August 15, 2019, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Due to the ability of the holders of the 2020 Notes to convert within the next year, the carrying value of the 2020 Notes were classified as current liabilities as of September 30, 2018. The respective balances were classified as long-term as of December 31, 2017. 2023 NotesOn June 28, 2018, WMG issued $675 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2023 Notes Indenture), dated as of June 28, 2018, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2023 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us on a senior unsecured basis. The 2023 Notes are referred to as \"exchangeable\" in the 2023 Notes Indenture because they were issued by WMG, not us. The 2023 Notes require interest to be paid at an annual rate of 1.625% semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15 and will mature on June 15, 2023 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2023 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2023 Notes is 29.9679 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2023 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2023 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $33.37 per ordinary share. WMG may not redeem the 2023 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2023 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2023 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2022 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2023 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after December 15, 2022 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2023 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2023 Notes Indenture. If a fundamental change, as defined in the 2023 Notes Indenture, occurs, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2023 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2023 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2023 Notes Indenture. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the 2023 Notes Indenture, that occurs prior to the maturity date, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2023 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Our guarantee of the 2023 Notes is our senior unsecured obligation that ranks: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the guarantee; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $12.4 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2023 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2023 Notes Exchange Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2023 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2023 Notes Exchange Derivative. The fair value of the 2023 Notes Exchange Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2023 Notes was $124.6 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2023 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2023 Notes using an effective interest rate of 6.06%. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded $4.9 million and $5.1 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount, respectively. The components of the 2023 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2018Principal amount of 2023 Notes$675,000Unamortized debt discount(119,519)Unamortized debt issuance costs(12,906)Net carrying amount of 2023 Notes$542,575The estimated fair value of the 2023 Notes was approximately $715.8 million at September 30, 2018, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We and WMG entered into 2023 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes with two counterparties. The 2023 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2023 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change; (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2023 Note Hedges; (iii) our or WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2023 Notes Indenture or under the 2023 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain defaults on our, WMG's or any our other subsidiary's indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if we, WMG or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2023 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2023 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2023 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2023 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2023 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2023 Notes Hedges was $141.3 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2023 Notes Hedges and the 2023 Notes Exchange Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants that are initially exercisable into 20.2 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, for an aggregate of $102.1 million. The strike price of the warrants is $40.86 per share, which was 50% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on June 20, 2018. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 120 trading day period beginning on September 15, 2023. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $141.3 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2023 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2023 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2023 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2023 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2023 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2023 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2023 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2023 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2020 Notes for the 2023 Notes.2021 NotesOn May 20, 2016, we issued $395 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2021 Notes Indenture), dated as of May 20, 2016, between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2021 Notes require interest to be paid at an annual rate of 2.25% semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15 and will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2021 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, solely into cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2021 Notes will be 46.8165 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2021 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2021 Notes Indenture), which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.36 per ordinary share. We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2021 Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2021 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at any time prior to May 15, 2021 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2021 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2021 Notes Indenture. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, we, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2021 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2021 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $7.3 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method.As of September 30, 2018, the closing price of our ordinary shares was greater than 130% of the 2021 Notes conversion price for 20 or more of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-end; and, therefore, the holders of the 2021 Notes may convert the notes during the succeeding quarterly period. Due to the ability of the holders of the 2021 Notes to convert the notes during this period, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative were classified as current liabilities, and the fair value of the 2021 Notes Hedges were classified as current assets as of September 30, 2018. The respective balances were classified as long-term as of December 25, 2016. We currently do not expect significant conversions because the 2021 Notes currently trade at a premium to the as-converted value, and a converting holder would forego future interest payments. However, any conversions would reduce our cash resources. We believe that, in the event that holders elect to exercise the conversion option, our cash resources and access to additional borrowings would provide the necessary liquidity.The 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2021 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2021 Notes was $117.2 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes using an effective rate of 9.72%. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded $5.0 million and $14.8 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount. For the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017, we recorded $4.6 million and $13.4 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount.The components of the 2021 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Principal amount of 2021 Notes$395,000 $395,000Unamortized debt discount(74,552) (89,332)Unamortized debt issuance costs(4,655) (5,617)Net carrying amount of 2021 Notes$315,793 $300,051The estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately $572.8 million at September 30, 2018, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).We entered into 2021 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes with two counterparties. The 2021 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that we would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2021 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2021 Notes Indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2021 Note Hedges; (iii) our failure to perform certain obligations under the 2021 Notes Indenture or under the 2021 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on our existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if we or any of our significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Notes Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Notes Hedges and warrant transactions upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2021 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2021 Notes Hedges was $99.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2021 Notes Hedges and the 2021 Notes Conversion Derivative.We also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of 18.5 million ordinary shares to the two option counterparties, subject to adjustment, for an aggregate of $54.6 million. The strike price of the warrants is $30.00 per share, which was 69% above the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on May 12, 2016. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 100 trading day period beginning on February 15, 2022. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.Aside from the initial payment of the $99.8 million premium in the aggregate to the two option counterparties and subject to the right of the option counterparties to terminate the 2021 Notes Hedges in certain circumstances, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2021 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2021 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2021 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2021 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2021 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of shares equal in value to one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares into which the 2021 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.As described in more detail below, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes exchanged their 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes.2020 NotesOn February 13, 2015, WMG issued $632.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2020 Notes Indenture), dated as of February 13, 2015 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2020 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%, and mature on February 15, 2020 unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2020 Notes were initially issued whereby they were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 32.3939 shares of WMG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $30.87 per share of WMG common stock. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. executed a supplemental indenture, fully and unconditionally guaranteeing, on a senior unsecured basis, WMG’s obligations relating to the 2020 Notes, changing the underlying reference securities from WMG common stock to Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and making a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price. From and after the effective time of the Wright/Tornier merger, (i) all calculations and other determinations with respect to the 2020 Notes previously based on references to WMG common stock are calculated or determined by reference to our ordinary shares, and (ii) the conversion rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) for the 2020 Notes was adjusted to a conversion rate of 33.39487 ordinary shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the 2020 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $29.94 per ordinary share (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the 2020 Notes Indenture). The 2020 Notes may not be redeemed by WMG prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” is available for the 2020 Notes, which means that WMG is not required to redeem or retire the 2020 Notes periodically.The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to August 15, 2019 solely into cash, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, upon satisfaction of one or more of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Wright/Tornier merger did not result in a conversion right for holders of the 2020 Notes. On or after August 15, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2020 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash, per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Notes, equal to the settlement amount as calculated under the 2020 Notes Indenture. If WMG undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the option to require WMG to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate transactions, WMG, under certain circumstances, will increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2020 Notes in connection with such corporate transaction. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2020 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded deferred financing charges of approximately $18.1 million, which are being amortized over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method.Due to the ability of the holders of the 2020 Notes to convert within the next year, the carrying value of the 2020 Notes and the fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivatives were classified as current liabilities and the fair value of the 2020 Notes Hedges was classified as current assets as of September 30, 2018. The respective balances were all classified as long-term as of December 31, 2017. The 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative requires bifurcation from the 2020 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and is accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2020 Notes was $149.8 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2020 Notes. This discount is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes based upon an effective rate of 8.54%. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded $2.4 million and $16.7 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount. For the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017, we recorded $6.9 million and $20.3 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount.Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $45 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $990.00 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes and the rounded amount. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $45 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $9.3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount.Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2023 Notes, certain holders of the 2020 Notes exchanged approximately $400.9 million aggregate principal amount of their 2020 Notes for the 2023 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,138.70 principal amount of the 2023 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Notes for each exchanging investor, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor. As a result of this note exchange and retirement of $400.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, we recognized approximately $39.9 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended July 1, 2018. The components of the 2020 Notes were as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Principal amount of 2020 Notes$186,589 $587,500Unamortized debt discount(14,081) (66,418)Unamortized debt issuance costs(1,710) (8,068)Net carrying amount of 2020 Notes$170,798 $513,014The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes was approximately $204.7 million at September 30, 2018, based on a quoted price in an active market (Level 1).WMG entered into the 2020 Notes Hedges in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes with three option counterparties. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2020 Notes Hedges. The 2020 Notes Hedges, which are cash-settled, are generally intended to reduce WMG's exposure to potential cash payments that WMG would be required to make if holders elect to convert the 2020 Notes at a time when our ordinary share price exceeds the conversion price. However, in connection with certain events, including, among others, (i) a merger or other make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2020 Notes indenture); (ii) certain hedging disruption events, which may include changes in tax laws, an increase in the cost of borrowing our ordinary shares in the market or other material increases in the cost to the option counterparties of hedging the 2020 Note Hedges; (iii) WMG's failure to perform certain obligations under the 2020 Notes Indenture or under the 2020 Notes Hedges; (iv) certain payment defaults on WMG's existing indebtedness in excess of $25 million; or (v) if WMG or any of its significant subsidiaries become insolvent or otherwise becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the option counterparties have the discretion to terminate the 2020 Note Hedges at a value determined by them in a commercially reasonable manner and/or adjust the terms of the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. In addition, the option counterparties have broad discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Notes Hedges upon the occurrence of certain other events, including, among others, (i) any adjustment to the conversion rate of the 2020 Notes; or (ii) upon the announcement of certain significant corporate events, including events that may give rise to a termination event as described above, such as the announcement of a third-party tender offer. Any such adjustment may also reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. The aggregate cost of the 2020 Notes Hedges was $144.8 million and is accounted for as a derivative asset in accordance with ASC Topic 815. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2020 Notes Hedges and the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivative. WMG also entered into warrant transactions in which it sold warrants for an aggregate of 20.5 million shares of WMG common stock to the three option counterparties, subject to adjustment. The strike price of the warrants was initially $40 per share of WMG common stock, which was 59% above the last reported sale price of WMG common stock on February 9, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Wright Medical Group N.V. assumed WMG's obligations pursuant to the warrants. Following the assumption, the warrants became exercisable for 21.1 million Wright Medical Group N.V. ordinary shares and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to $38.8010 per ordinary share. The warrants are expected to be net-share settled and exercisable over the 200 trading day period beginning on May 15, 2020. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our ordinary shares to the extent that the market value per ordinary share during such period exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to warrant transactions, which may increase our obligations under the warrant transactions.During the second quarter of 2016, we settled a portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges (receiving $3.9 million) and repurchased a portion of the warrants associated with the 2020 Notes (paying $3.3 million), generating net proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. During the second quarter of 2018, we agreed to settle a pro rata portion of the 2020 Notes Hedges and agreed to repurchase a pro rata portion of the warrants associated with the 2020 Notes. The pricing of these 2020 Notes Hedges and warrants associated with the 2020 Notes were based on pricing between July 9, 2018 and July 27, 2018 and were settled on July 30, 2018. As a result of these settlements, we received net proceeds of approximately $10.6 million on July 30, 2018. As we had agreed to settle a portion of the warrants in cash prior to July 1, 2018, we had warrants which were exercisable for 6.2 million ordinary shares with a strike price of $38.8010 per ordinary share as of July 1, 2018. The warrants which we had agreed to settle as of July 1, 2018 are recorded as a current derivative liability as of July 1, 2018 as described within Note 6. Aside from the initial payment of the $144.8 million premium in the aggregate to the option counterparties, we do not expect to be required to make any cash payments to the option counterparties under the 2020 Notes Hedges and expect to be entitled to receive from the option counterparties cash, generally equal to the amount by which the market price per ordinary share exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedging transactions during the relevant valuation period. The strike price under the 2020 Notes Hedges is initially equal to the conversion price of the 2020 Notes. However, in connection with certain events, these option counterparties have the discretion to make certain adjustments to the 2020 Note Hedges, which may reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Note Hedges. Additionally, if the market value per ordinary share exceeds the strike price on any settlement date under the warrant transaction, we will generally be obligated to issue to the option counterparties in the aggregate a number of ordinary shares equal in value to one half of one percent of the amount by which the then-current market value of one ordinary share exceeds the then-effective strike price of each warrant, multiplied by the number of reference ordinary shares into which the 2020 Notes are initially convertible. We will not receive any additional proceeds if warrants are exercised.2017 NotesOn August 31, 2012, WMG issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes pursuant to an indenture (2017 Notes Indenture), dated as of August 31, 2012 between WMG and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2017 Notes matured on August 15, 2017. Prior to maturity, we paid interest on the 2017 Notes semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15 at an annual rate of 2.00%. WMG could not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to the maturity date, and no “sinking fund” was available for the 2017 Notes, which means that WMG was not required to redeem or retire the 2017 Notes periodically. The 2017 Notes were convertible at the option of the holder, during certain periods and subject to certain conditions as described below, solely into cash at an initial conversion rate of 39.3140 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events, which represented an initial conversion price of $25.44 per share. Holders could have converted their 2017 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2017 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2017 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders could convert their 2017 Notes solely into cash, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. The 2017 Notes were senior unsecured obligations that ranked: (i) senior in right of payment to any of WMG's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2017 Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to any of WMG's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of WMG's subsidiaries. As a result of the issuance of the 2017 Notes, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $8.8 million, which were amortized over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method.The 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative required bifurcation from the 2017 Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and was accounted for as a derivative liability. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative. The fair value of the 2017 Notes Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2017 Notes was $48.1 million and was recorded as original debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 Notes. This discount was amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2017 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017, interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount based upon an effective rate of 6.47% was negligible. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes on February 13, 2015, WMG repurchased and extinguished $240 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and settled all of the 2017 Notes Hedges (receiving $70 million) and repurchased all of the warrants (paying $60 million) associated with the 2017 Notes. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized approximately $25.1 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Concurrently with the issuance and sale of the 2021 Notes, certain holders of the 2017 Notes exchanged approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount their 2017 Notes for the 2021 Notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes validly submitted for exchange, we delivered $1,035.40 principal amount of 2021 Notes (subject to rounding down to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, the difference being referred as the rounded amount) to the investor plus an amount of cash equal to the unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and the rounded amount. In addition, during the three months ended June 26, 2016, we repurchased and extinguished an additional $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. As a result of this exchange and these repurchases, we recognized approximately $3 million for the write-off of related pro-rata unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount within “Other (income) expense, net” in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 26, 2016.ABL FacilityOn December 23, 2016, we, together with WMG and certain of our other wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, Borrowers), entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (ABL Credit Agreement) with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent (Agent) and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a $150 million senior secured asset-based line of credit, subject to the satisfaction of a borrowing base requirement (ABL Facility). The ABL Facility may be increased by up to $100 million upon the Borrowers’ request, subject to the consent of the Agent and each of the other lenders providing such increase. All borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default, the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects and the delivery of an updated borrowing base certificate. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $21.5 million and $53.6 million respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. We have reflected this debt as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, as required by US GAAP due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the agreement, as well as the ability for the lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt under certain circumstances as described below. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $1.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the ABL Facility. These amounts are included within \"Other assets\" on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Facility as described below.The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the ABL Facility is, at the option of the Borrowers, equal to either (a) 3.25% for base rate loans or (b) 4.25% for LIBOR rate loans, subject to a 0.75% LIBOR floor. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility, the Borrowers also are required to pay a customary unused line fee equal to 0.50% per annum in respect of unutilized commitments and certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the ABL Facility. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Borrowers are required to maintain a minimum drawn balance on the ABL Facility equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for each month. To the extent the actual drawn balance is less than 20%, the Borrowers must pay a fee equal to the amount the lenders under the ABL Facility would have earned had the Borrowers maintained a minimum drawn balance equal to 20% of the average borrowing base for such month. The ABL Credit Agreement requires that the Borrowers calculate the borrowing base for the ABL Facility on at least a monthly basis and each time the Borrowers make a draw on the ABL Facility in accordance with the formula set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. The borrowing base is subject to adjustment and the implementation of reserves by the Agent in its permitted discretion, as further described in the ABL Credit Agreement. If at any time the outstanding drawn balance under the ABL Facility exceeds the borrowing base as in effect at such time, Borrowers will be required to prepay loans under the ABL Facility in an amount equal to such excess. Certain accounts receivables and proceeds of collateral of the Borrowers will be applied to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the ABL Facility on a periodic basis. There is no scheduled amortization under the ABL Facility and (subject to borrowing base requirements and applicable conditions to borrowing) the available revolving commitment may be borrowed, repaid, and reborrowed without restriction. All outstanding loans under the ABL Facility will be due and payable in full on the date that is the earliest to occur of (x) December 23, 2021; (y) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2020 Notes or (z) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2021 Notes; provided that, the springing maturity under clauses (y) and (z) are subject to the Borrowers’ ability to refinance, extend, renew or replace the 2020 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes, as applicable, in full pursuant to the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement. Any voluntary or mandatory permanent reduction or termination of the revolving commitments under the ABL Facility is subject to a prepayment premium applicable to such reduced or terminated amount equal to (i) 3.0% through December 23, 2017, (ii) 2.0% from December 24, 2017 through December 23, 2018, and (iii) 0.75% at any time thereafter. The ABL Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions as specified in the ABL Credit Agreement and an affirmative covenant that we maintain net revenue at or above minimum levels and maintain liquidity in the United States at a level specified in the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. All of the obligations under the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by Wright Medical Group N.V. and each of the Borrowers on the terms set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of Wright Medical Group N.V. and each Borrower. On May 7, 2018, we amended and restated the ABL Credit Agreement to add a $40 million term loan facility (Term Loan Facility). The initial $20 million term loan tranche was funded at closing. The Borrowers may at any time borrow the second $20 million term loan tranche, but will be required to do so no later than May 7, 2019 unless certain adjusted EBITDA targets are met; in which case, the Borrowers will be permitted to extend the borrowing requirement for up to an additional two years. All borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default and the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects. As of September 30, 2018, we had $20 million outstanding under the term loan facility.The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will be equal to one-month LIBOR plus 7.85%, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. Amortization payments under the Term Loan Facility are due in equal monthly installments beginning on May 1, 2019 unless we meet certain adjusted EBITDA targets; in which case, the amortization payments would not commence until May 1, 2021. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility, the Borrowers will also be required to pay certain other customary fees related to Agent’s administration of the Term Loan Facility.The Term Loan Facility requires mandatory prepayments, subject to the right of reinvestment and certain other exceptions, in amounts equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and casualty and condemnation events in excess of $10 million in any fiscal year. Any voluntary or mandatory prepayment under the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain exceptions, is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium. The advances under the Term Loan Facility will be due and payable in full at the same time as the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility. As a result of the Term Loan Facility, we recognized deferred financing charges of approximately $1.2 million, which will be amortized over the three-year term using the effective interest method.All of the obligations under the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by us and each of the Borrowers and are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of us and each Borrower on the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement. In addition to financial and liquidity covenants consistent with those in the ABL Credit Agreement, while the Term Loan Facility is outstanding, the Company is required to maintain a minimum adjusted EBITDA, as described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The ABL Credit Agreement will not affect our ability to meet our existing contractual obligations, including payments under the Borrower Representative’s contingent value rights agreement, except in circumstances where an event of default (subject to certain exceptions) has occurred and is continuing. The ABL Credit Agreement also contains negative covenants, representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, in each case subject to grace periods, thresholds, and materiality qualifiers consistent with the ABL Credit Agreement. Other Debt Other debt primarily includes mortgages, shareholder debt, and loans acquired as a result of the IMASCAP acquisition. We have mortgages that had an outstanding balance of $0.5 million and $1.0 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These mortgages are secured by an office building in Montbonnot, France and bear fixed annual interest rates of 2.55%-4.9%. As a result of the IMASCAP acquisition, we have two zero interest loans with a state investment company that had an outstanding balance of $1.0 million and $1.2 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We also had shareholder debt outstanding of $1.5 million and $1.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The remainder of other debt totaled approximately $6.0 million and $4.2 million as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The shareholder debt was acquired in conjunction with the Wright/Tornier merger. This debt was the result of a 2008 transaction where a 51%-owned and consolidated subsidiary of legacy Tornier borrowed $2.2 million from a then-current member of the legacy Tornier board of directors, who was also a 49% owner of the consolidated subsidiary. This loan was used to partially fund the purchase of real estate in Grenoble, France, to be used as a manufacturing facility. Interest on the debt is variable-based on the three-month Euro Libor rate plus 0.5% and has no stated term.\n",

See Note 2 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives. (b) The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The notes are convertible, at the holder's option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarter by quarter. In the first quarter of 2011, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the second quarter of 2011 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder's option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note's conversion value in excess of such principal amount. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years, under certain conditions. We may redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash.

This discount is based on an effective yield method. (d) See Note 2 for further discussion related to these instruments. Senior Notes Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Our senior note obligations are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries, excluding Chesapeake Midstream Development, L.P. (CMD) and its subsidiaries. See Note 11 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries. We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain secured indebtedness; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. These rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively. During the Current Quarter, we issued $1.0 billion of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 in a registered public offering. We used the net proceeds of $977 million from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility. During the Current Quarter, we repurchased $140 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 for approximately $129 million, including accrued interest. Associated with these repurchases, we recognized a loss of $2 million in the Current Quarter. During the Prior Quarter, holders of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 exchanged approximately $11 million in aggregate principal amount for an aggregate of 298,500 shares of our common stock in privately negotiated exchanges. Associated with these exchanges, we recognized a loss of $2 million in the Prior Quarter. No scheduled principal payments are required under our senior notes until 2013 when $500 million is due. Bank Credit Facilities We utilize two revolving bank credit facilities, described below, as sources of liquidity. CorporateCredit Facility(a) MidstreamCredit Facility(b) ($ in millions) Facility structure Senior secured revolving Senior secured revolving Maturity date December 2015 July 2015 Borrowing capacity $ 4,000 $ 300 Amount outstanding as of March 31, 2011 $ — $ — Letters of credit outstanding as of March 31, 2011 $ 13 $ — (a) Borrower is Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C. (b) Borrower is Chesapeake Midstream Operating, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake Midstream Development, L.P. Our credit facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants. Although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, neither of our credit facilities contains provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Corporate Credit Facility Our $4.0 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the facility are secured by natural gas and oil proved reserves and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank, N.A. or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are determined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens and require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, in each case as defined in the agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement at March 31, 2011. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $50 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $125 million. The facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by Chesapeake and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Midstream Credit Facility Our $300 million midstream syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures to build natural gas gathering and other systems for our drilling program and for general corporate purposes associated with our midstream operations. Borrowings under the midstream credit facility are secured by all of the assets of the wholly owned subsidiaries (the restricted subsidiaries) of CMD, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake, and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which are subject to a margin that varies from 1.75% to 2.25% per annum according to the most recent leverage ratio described below or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on the LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 2.75% to 3.25% per annum according to the most recent leverage ratio. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The midstream credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit the ability of CMD and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The agreement requires maintenance of a leverage ratio based on the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and an interest coverage ratio based on the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, in each case as defined in the agreement. The leverage ratio increases during any three-quarter period, beginning in the quarter in which CMD makes a material disposition of assets to our master limited partnership midstream affiliate, Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.P. As of December 21, 2010, the leverage ratio increased for a three-fiscal-quarter period beginning October 1, 2010 due to the sale of the Springridge gathering system, as it was classified as a material disposition of assets. We were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement at March 31, 2011. If CMD or its restricted subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. The midstream credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness CMD and its restricted subsidiaries may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $15 million. Other Financings In 2009, we financed 113 real estate surface assets in the Barnett Shale area for approximately $145 million and entered into a 40-year master lease agreement under which we agreed to lease the sites for approximately $15 million to $27 million annually. This lease transaction was recorded as a financing lease and the cash received was recorded with an offsetting long-term liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Chesapeake exercised its option to repurchase two of the assets in 2010. As of March 31, 2011, 111 assets were leased and the minimum aggregate undiscounted future lease payments were approximately $824 million. This obligation is recorded in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. In 2009, we financed our regional Barnett Shale headquarters building in Fort Worth, Texas for net proceeds of approximately $54 million with a five-year term loan which has a floating rate of prime plus 275 basis points. At our option, we may prepay in full without penalty beginning in year four. This obligation is recorded in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. \n",

See Note 7 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives. (b) Issuers are Chesapeake Oilfield Operating, L.L.C. (COO) and Chesapeake Oilfield Finance, Inc. (COF), a wholly owned subsidiary of COO formed solely to facilitate the offering of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2019. COF is nominally capitalized and has no operations or revenues. Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the issuer of all other senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes. (c) The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The notes are convertible, at the holder's option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarter by quarter. In the first quarter of 2012, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the second quarter of 2012 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder's option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note's conversion value in excess of such principal amount. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years, under certain conditions. We may redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding forten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash.

Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior Notes The Chesapeake senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake's obligations under the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Chesapeake Midstream Development, L.P. (CMD) and its subsidiaries, Chesapeake Oilfield Services, L.L.C. (COS) and its subsidiaries, CHK Utica, L.L.C., CHK Cleveland Tonkawa, L.L.C., Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust and certain de minimis subsidiaries are not guarantors. See Note 13 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries. We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The indentures governing the contingent convertible senior notes do not have any financial or restricted payment covenants. We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. These rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively. During the Current Quarter, we issued $1.3 billion of 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 in a registered public offering. We used the net proceeds of $1.263 billion from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility. At any time from and including November 15, 2012 to and including March 15, 2013, we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date; provided that upon any redemption of the notes in part (and not in whole) pursuant to this redemption provision, at least $250 million aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding. During the Prior Quarter, we issued $1.0 billion of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 in a registered public offering. We used the net proceeds of $977 million from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility. During the Prior Quarter, we purchased $140 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 for approximately $128 million. Associated with these purchases, we recognized a loss of $2 million. No scheduled principal payments are required under our senior notes until July 2013 when $464 million is due. COO Senior Notes In October 2011, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Chesapeake Oilfield Operating, L.L.C. (COO) and Chesapeake Oilfield Finance, Inc. issued $650 million principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2019 in a private placement. COO used the net proceeds of approximately $637 million from the placement to make a cash distribution to its direct parent, COS, to enable it to reduce indebtedness under an intercompany note with Chesapeake. Chesapeake then used the cash distribution to reduce indebtedness under its corporate revolving bank credit facility. The COO senior notes are the unsecured senior obligations of COO and rank equally in right of payment with all of COO's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of its future subordinated indebtedness. The COO senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of COO's wholly owned subsidiaries, other than de minimis subsidiaries. The notes may be redeemed at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices and, prior to November 15, 2014, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount may be redeemed in connection with certain equity offerings. Holders of the COO notes have the right to require COO to repurchase their notes upon a change of control on the terms set forth in the indenture, and COO must offer to repurchase the notes upon certain asset sales. The COO senior notes are subject to covenants that may, among other things, limit the ability of COO and its subsidiaries to make restricted payments, incur indebtedness, issue preferred stock, create liens, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets.

(e) We estimate the capacity was limited to approximately $450 million as of March 31, 2012 by certain restrictive provisions. Our corporate and oilfield services credit facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants. Although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, our credit facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the respective facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Corporate Credit Facility Our $4.0 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the facility are secured by natural gas and oil proved reserves and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank, N.A. or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are determined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens and require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, in each case as defined in the agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement at March 31, 2012. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $50 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $125 million. The facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by Chesapeake and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Midstream Credit Facility Our $600 million midstream syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures to build natural gas gathering and other systems in support of our drilling program and for general corporate purposes associated with our midstream operations. Borrowings under the midstream credit facility are secured by all of the assets, other than certain joint venture equity interests, of the wholly owned subsidiaries (the restricted subsidiaries) of CMD, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake. Amounts outstanding bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which are subject to a margin that varies from 1.00% to 1.75% or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on the LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee that varies from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum. Both margins and commitment fees are determined according to the most recent leverage ratio described below. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The midstream credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit the ability of CMD and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The agreement requires maintenance of a leverage ratio based on the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and an interest coverage ratio based on the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, in each case as defined in the agreement. The leverage ratio increases during any three-quarter period, beginning in the quarter in which CMD makes a material disposition of assets to our midstream master limited partnership affiliate, Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.P. (CHKM). In December 2011, the leverage ratio increased for a three-fiscal-quarter period beginning October 1, 2011 due to the sale of CMD's wholly owned subsidiary, Appalachia Midstream Services, L.L.C. (AMS), as it was classified as a material disposition of assets. As a result, the capacity of the midstream credit facility was limited to approximately $370 million as of March 31, 2012. We were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement at March 31, 2012. If CMD or its restricted subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. The midstream credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness CMD and its restricted subsidiaries may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $15 million. Oilfield Services Credit Facility Our $500 million oilfield services syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes associated with our oilfield services operations. Borrowings under the oilfield services credit facility are secured by all of the assets of the wholly owned subsidiaries of COO, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake. The facility has initial commitments of $500 million and may be expanded to $900 million at COO's option, subject to additional bank participation. Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all of the equity interests and assets of COO and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the restricted subsidiaries), and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Bank of America, N.A., the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which are subject to a margin that varies from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The unused portion of the credit facility is subject to a commitment fee that varies from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum. Both margins and commitment fees are determined according to the most recent leverage ratio described below. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The oilfield services credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit the ability of COO and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The agreement requires maintenance of a leverage ratio based on the ratio of lease adjusted indebtedness to EBITDAR, a senior secured leverage ratio based on the ratio of secured indebtedness to EBITDA and a fixed charge coverage ratio based on the ratio of lease adjusted interest expense to EBITDAR, in each case as defined in the agreement. As a result of those covenants, the capacity of the oilfield services credit facility was limited to approximately $450 million as of March 31, 2012. We were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement at March 31, 2012. If COO or its restricted subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. The oilfield services credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness COO and its restricted subsidiaries may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $15 million. \n",

There is $1 million of discount associated with these notes.(c)The principal amount shown is based on the exchange rate of $1.2856 to €1.00 and $1.2973 to €1.00 as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. See Note 7 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives.(d)Issuers are Chesapeake Oilfield Operating, L.L.C. (COO), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Chesapeake Oilfield Finance, Inc. (COF), a wholly owned subsidiary of COO formed solely to facilitate the offering of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2019. COF is nominally capitalized and has no operations or revenues. Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the issuer of all other senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes.(e)The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. In the third quarter of 2012, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the fourth quarter of 2012 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of such principal amount. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years, under certain conditions. We may redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. The optional repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 $48.51 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $63.93 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $107.27 June 14, 2019(f)Discount as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 included $393 million and $444 million, respectively, associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible senior notes. This discount is based on an effective yield method. Also includes $114 million associated with our Term Loans due 2017 that were fully repaid subsequent to September 30, 2012.(g)See Note 7 for further discussion related to these instruments.Term LoansIn May 2012, we entered into $4.0 billion of unsecured term loans under a credit agreement that provided for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. The net proceeds of the term loans of approximately $3.789 billion after discount, customary fees and syndication costs were used to repay borrowings under our corporate revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The term loans were issued at a discount of 3%, or $120 million, and the customary fees and syndication costs incurred were approximately $91 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2012, we used $4.0 billion in proceeds from asset sales and our new term loan (see Note 16) to fully repay the May 2012 term loans. We will record $155 million of associated losses with the repayment, including $86 million of deferred charges and $114 million of debt discount, offset by $45 million of interest accrued that will not be paid. Provisions that applied when the term loans were outstanding are described below. Amounts borrowed under the term loan credit agreement bear interest, at our option, at either (a) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin (as described below) or (b) a base rate equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate quoted in the Wall Street Journal, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum and (iii) the Eurodollar rate that would be applicable to a Eurodollar loan with an interest period of one month plus 1% per annum, in each case, plus a margin. The Eurodollar rate is subject to a floor of 1.50% per annum and the base rate is subject to a floor of 2.50% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if the Eurodollar rate applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The initial applicable margin for Eurodollar loans is 7.0% per annum and the initial applicable margin for base rate loans is 6.0% per annum. If any amounts remain outstanding under the term loan credit agreement following January 1, 2013, the applicable margin under the term loan credit agreement will increase to 10.0% per annum for Eurodollar loans and to 9.0% per annum for base rate loans. Due to the escalating rate characteristic of the loan, we recognize interest expense using the interest method which, based on the current applicable interest rates, yields an 11.16% interest rate over the loan term. To the extent interest rates increase above the current applicable rates, the increase will be accounted for in the applicable period.Amounts outstanding under the term loan credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of the Company’s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (including the subsidiaries that are subsidiary guarantors under our corporate revolving bank credit facility). The term loans are not secured by any assets of the Company or its subsidiaries.The term loans, which rank equally in right of payment with our outstanding senior notes, mature on December 2, 2017 and may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time in 2012 without premium or penalty. On and following January 1, 2013, we are required to pay a yield maintenance premium, equal to the present value of all interest payments that would have been made in respect of the principal of such loans from the date of such prepayment to maturity, in connection with any prepayment (including the prepayments described in the following paragraph) prior to December 2, 2017.The term loan credit agreement contains negative covenants substantially similar to those contained in the Company’s corporate revolving bank credit facility, including covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, loans and restricted payments and enter into certain business combination transactions. Other covenants include additional restrictions regarding the incurrence of certain unsecured indebtedness, the incurrence of secured indebtedness, the increase of dividends or payment of special dividends, investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and designations of subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. The term loan credit agreement also contains a covenant that requires that the net cash proceeds from certain asset dispositions and other asset sales, including assets of the Company or its subsidiaries in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, and certain financing transactions (both subject to certain thresholds and exceptions) be used to either (a) prepay loans outstanding under the term loan credit agreement or (b) reduce the commitments and repay amounts outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility (or, to the extent the proceeds exceed the commitments under the revolving facility, other senior debt). If, prior to January 1, 2013, we use such designated proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility, then the applicable margin under the term loan credit agreement will increase to 8.0% per annum for Eurodollar loans and 7.0% per annum for base rate loans. The term loan credit agreement does not contain financial maintenance covenants.We were in compliance with all covenants under the term loan credit agreement at September 30, 2012. If we should fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, the term loans could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the term loan credit agreement could be declared immediately due and payable. The term loan credit agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $125 million.On and after May 11, 2013, the lenders will have the option (subject to certain thresholds) to exchange their loans under the term loan credit agreement for fixed rate notes (Exchange Notes). The Exchange Notes will bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 11.50%, payable semi-annually, will mature on December 2, 2017, will not be subject to any sinking fund or amortization and will contain substantially the same call protection (in the form of a customary treasury rate plus 50 basis points bond make-whole), covenants and events of default as the loans under the term loan credit agreement. The Exchange Notes will rank equally in right of payment with the loans under the term loan credit agreement.Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesThe Chesapeake senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain of our oilfield services subsidiaries, subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests, subsidiaries qualified as variable interest entities, and certain midstream and de minimis subsidiaries are not guarantors. See Note 14 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The indentures governing the contingent convertible senior notes do not have any financial or restricted payment covenants. The senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes indentures have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness the Company or any guarantor subsidiary may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of $50 million or $75 million, depending on the indenture.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. These rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8% and 8%, respectively.During the Current Period, we issued $1.3 billion of 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 in a registered public offering. We used the net proceeds of $1.263 billion from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility. At any time from and including November 15, 2012 to and including March 15, 2013, we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date; provided that upon any redemption of the notes in part (and not in whole) pursuant to this redemption provision, at least $250 million aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding.During the Prior Period, we completed and settled tender offers to purchase the following senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes. We funded the purchase of the notes with a portion of the net proceeds we received from the sale of our Fayetteville Shale assets. See Note 8 for further discussion of our Fayetteville Shale asset sale.

Simultaneously with our purchase of the euro-denominated senior notes, we unwound cross currency swaps for the same principal amount. See Note 7 for additional information.We paid $2.058 billion in cash for the tender offers described above and recorded associated losses of approximately $174 million. The losses included $154 million in cash premiums, $20 million of deferred charges, $160 million of note discounts and $2 million of interest rate hedging losses, offset by $162 million of the equity component of the contingent convertible notes.During the Prior Period, we issued $1.0 billion of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 in a registered public offering. We used the net proceeds of $977 million from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility.During the Prior Period, we purchased $140 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 for approximately $128 million. Associated with these purchases, we recognized a loss of $2 million.In July 2013, the $464 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% senior notes will be due. No other scheduled principal payments are required on our senior notes until 2015.COO Senior NotesIn October 2011, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Chesapeake Oilfield Operating, L.L.C. (COO) and Chesapeake Oilfield Finance, Inc. (COF), issued $650 million principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2019 in a private placement. COO used the net proceeds of approximately $637 million from the placement to make a cash distribution to its direct parent, COS, to enable it to reduce indebtedness under an intercompany note with Chesapeake. Chesapeake then used the cash distribution to reduce indebtedness under its corporate revolving bank credit facility.The COO senior notes are the unsecured senior obligations of COO and rank equally in right of payment with all of COO’s other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of its future subordinated indebtedness. The COO senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of COO’s wholly owned subsidiaries, other than de minimis subsidiaries. The notes may be redeemed at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices and, prior to November 15, 2014, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount may be redeemed in connection with certain equity offerings. Holders of the COO notes have the right to require COO to repurchase their notes upon a change of control on the terms set forth in the indenture, and COO must offer to repurchase the notes upon certain asset sales. The COO senior notes are subject to covenants that may, among other things, limit the ability of COO and its subsidiaries to make restricted payments, incur indebtedness, issue preferred stock, create liens, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The COO senior notes have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness COO or any of its guarantor subsidiaries may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of $50 million or more.Under a registration rights agreement, we agreed to file a registration statement within 365 days after the closing of the COO senior notes offering enabling holders of the COO senior notes to exchange the privately placed COO senior notes for publicly registered notes with substantially the same terms. We are required to use our commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after filing and to consummate the exchange offer on the earliest practicable date after such date, but in no event later than 60 days after the date the registration statement has become effective. We also agreed to make additional interest payments to holders, up to a maximum of 1% per annum, of the COO senior notes if we do not comply with our obligations under the registration rights agreement. We did not file a registration statement within 365 days after the closing of the COO senior notes and in the Current Quarter accrued approximately $1 million of additional expense we expect to incur related to this delay. Bank Credit FacilitiesDuring the Current Period, we used three revolving bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity. In June 2012, we paid off and terminated our midstream credit facility. Our two remaining revolving bank credit facilities are described below. CorporateCredit Facility(a) OilfieldServicesCreditFacility(b) ($ in millions)Facility structureSenior securedrevolving Senior securedrevolvingMaturity dateDecember 2015 November 2016Borrowing capacity$4,000 $500Amount outstanding as of September 30, 2012$1,785 $336Letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2012$31 $— ____________________________________________(a)Borrower is Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C.(b)Borrower is COO.Our corporate and oilfield services credit facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants. Although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, our credit facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the respective facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Corporate Credit Facility. Our $4.0 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the facility are secured by proved reserves and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank, N.A. or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on LIBOR, plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. These margins may be increased pursuant to the terms of the recent credit facility amendment discussed below. The collateral value and borrowing base are determined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals.The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens and require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, in each case as defined in the agreement. In September 2012, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility agreement, effective September 30, 2012. See Risks and Uncertainties in Note 1 for further discussion. The amendment, among other things, adjusts our required indebtedness to EBITDA ratio as set forth below through the earlier of (a) December 31, 2013 and (b) the date on which we elect to reinstate the indebtedness to EBITDA ratio in effect prior to the amendment (in either case, the \"Amendment Effective Period\"). The amendment increased the maximum indebtedness to EBITDA ratio as of September 30, 2012 from 4.00 to 1.00 to 6.00 to 1.00 and revises the required ratio for the next four quarters as shown below. The ratio returns to 4.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2013 and thereafter. Effective Date Indebtedness to EBITDA RatioDecember 31, 2012 5.00 to 1.00March 31, 2013 4.75 to 1.00June 30, 2013 4.50 to 1.00September 30, 2013 4.25 to 1.00The credit facility amendment increases the applicable margin by 0.25% for borrowings under the corporate credit facility on each day during the Amendment Effective Period when borrowings exceed 50% of the borrowing capacity and requires us to pay a fee to each lender in an amount equal to 0.05% of its revolving commitment in the event that the Amendment Effective Period is in effect on June 30, 2013. Based on current commitment levels, this would result in an additional payment of $2 million. The amendment does not allow our collateral value securing the borrowings to be more than $75 million below the collateral value that was in effect as of September 30, 2012 during the Amendment Effective Period. We were in compliance with all covenants under the amended agreement as of September 30, 2012. The facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by Chesapeake and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. If we should fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $50 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note and contingent convertible senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $125 million. Oilfield Services Credit Facility. Our $500 million syndicated oilfield services revolving bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes associated with our oilfield services operations. Borrowings under the oilfield services credit facility are secured by all of the assets of the wholly owned subsidiaries of COO, itself an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake. The facility has initial commitments of $500 million and may be expanded to $900 million at COO’s option, subject to additional bank participation. Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all of the equity interests and assets of COO and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the restricted subsidiaries for this facility, but they are unrestricted subsidiaries under Chesapeake's senior notes, contingent convertible senior notes and corporate revolving bank credit facility), and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Bank of America, N.A., the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which are subject to a margin that varies from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The unused portion of the credit facility is subject to a commitment fee that varies from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum. Both margins and commitment fees are determined according to the most recent leverage ratio described below. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals.The oilfield services credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit the ability of COO and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The agreement requires maintenance of a leverage ratio based on the ratio of lease adjusted indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (EBITDAR), a senior secured leverage ratio based on the ratio of secured indebtedness to EBITDA and a fixed charge coverage ratio based on the ratio of EBITDAR to lease adjusted interest expense, in each case as defined in the agreement. COO was in compliance with all covenants under the agreement at September 30, 2012. If COO or its restricted subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under the agreement, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $50 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our COO senior note indenture, which could in turn result in the acceleration of the COO senior note indebtedness. The oilfield services credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness COO and its restricted subsidiaries may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $15 million.Midstream Credit Facility. Prior to June 15, 2012, we utilized a $600 million midstream syndicated senior secured revolving bank credit facility to fund capital expenditures to build natural gas gathering and other systems in support of our drilling program and for general corporate purposes associated with our midstream operations. With the anticipated sale of our midstream business in the second half of 2012, on June 15, 2012, we paid off and terminated our midstream credit facility.\n",

(e)The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. In the first quarter of 2013, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the second quarter of 2013 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. During the Current Quarter, the notes were not convertible under this provision. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of such principal amount. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years, under certain conditions. We may redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. The optional repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 $48.31 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $63.93 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $107.01 June 14, 2019(f)Discount as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 included $359 million and $376 million, respectively, associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible senior notes. This discount is amortized based on an effective yield method. Also included $37 million and $40 million of discount as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, associated with our November 2012 term loan.(g)See Note 7 for further discussion related to these instruments.Term LoanNovember 2012 Term Loan. In November 2012, we established an unsecured five-year term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion for net proceeds of $1.935 billion (November 2012 term loan). Our obligations under the facility rank equally with our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes and are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that are subsidiary guarantors under the indentures for such notes. Amounts borrowed under the facility bear interest at our option, at either (i) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin of 4.50% or (ii) a base rate equal to the greater of (a) the Bank of America, N.A. prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum and (c) the Eurodollar rate that would be applicable to a Eurodollar loan with an interest period of one month plus 1% per annum, in each case, plus a margin of 3.50%. The Eurodollar rate is subject to a floor of 1.25% per annum, and the base rate is subject to a floor of 2.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if the Eurodollar rate applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals.The November 2012 term loan matures on December 2, 2017 and may be voluntarily repaid at a make-whole price in the first year, may be voluntarily repaid in the second and third years at par plus a specified call premium and may be voluntarily repaid at any time thereafter at par. The term loan may also be refinanced or amended to extend the maturity date at our option, subject to lender approval.The November 2012 term loan credit agreement contains negative covenants substantially similar to those contained in the Company’s corporate revolving bank credit facility, including covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, loans and restricted payments and enter into certain business combination transactions. Other covenants include additional restrictions regarding the incurrence of certain unsecured indebtedness, the incurrence of secured indebtedness, the disposition of assets and the prepayment of certain indebtedness. The term loan credit agreement does not contain financial maintenance covenants.We were in compliance with all covenants under the November 2012 term loan credit agreement as of March 31, 2013. If we should fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, the term loan could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the term loan credit agreement could be declared immediately due and payable. The term loan credit agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $125 million. Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesThe Chesapeake senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain of our oilfield services subsidiaries and subsidiaries formed to invest in natural gas demand initiatives, subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests, subsidiaries qualified as variable interest entities, and certain de minimis subsidiaries are not guarantors. See Note 16 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The indentures governing the contingent convertible senior notes do not have any financial or restricted payment covenants. The senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes indentures have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness the Company or any guarantor subsidiary may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of $50 million or $75 million, depending on the indenture.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. These rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.During the Prior Quarter, we issued $1.3 billion of 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 in a registered public offering. We used the net proceeds of $1.263 billion from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our corporate revolving bank credit facility. On March 15, 2013, we provided notice to the trustee of our election to redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on May 13, 2013. See Note 18 for further discussion of litigation related to the redemption of these notes. The $464 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% senior notes, which is due in July 2013, was partially refinanced on a long-term basis subsequent to March 31, 2013 and the remaining balance will be repaid and/or retired upon maturity. No other scheduled principal payments are required on our senior notes until 2015. See Note 18 for further discussion of tender offers for certain series of our senior notes completed subsequent to March 31, 2013.COO Senior NotesIn October 2011, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Chesapeake Oilfield Operating, L.L.C. (COO) and Chesapeake Oilfield Finance, Inc., issued $650 million principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2019 in a private placement. COO used the net proceeds of approximately $637 million from the placement to make a cash distribution to its direct parent, COS Holdings, L.L.C. (COS), to enable it to reduce indebtedness under an intercompany note with Chesapeake. Chesapeake then used the cash distribution to reduce indebtedness under its corporate revolving bank credit facility.The COO senior notes are the unsecured senior obligations of COO and rank equally in right of payment with all of COO’s other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of its future subordinated indebtedness. The COO senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of COO’s wholly owned subsidiaries, other than de minimis subsidiaries. The notes may be redeemed at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices and, prior to November 15, 2014, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount may be redeemed in connection with certain equity offerings. Holders of the COO notes have the right to require COO to repurchase their notes upon a change of control on the terms set forth in the indenture, and COO must offer to repurchase the notes upon certain asset sales. The COO senior notes are subject to covenants that may, among other things, limit the ability of COO and its subsidiaries to make restricted payments, incur indebtedness, issue preferred stock, create liens, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The COO senior notes have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness COO or any of its guarantor subsidiaries may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of $50 million or more.Under a registration rights agreement, we agreed to file a registration statement enabling holders of the COO senior notes to exchange the privately placed COO senior notes for publicly registered notes with substantially the same terms. We filed the registration statement on April 5, 2013. We are required to use our commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after filing and to consummate the exchange offer on the earliest practicable date after such date, but in no event later than 60 days after the date the registration statement has become effective. Bank Credit FacilitiesDuring the Current Quarter, we used two revolving bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity. In addition, in the Prior Quarter, we utilized a midstream credit facility. In June 2012, we paid off and terminated our midstream credit facility. Our remaining revolving bank credit facilities are described below. CorporateCredit Facility(a) Oilfield ServicesCredit Facility(b) ($ in millions)Facility structure Senior securedrevolving Senior securedrevolvingMaturity date December 2015 November 2016Borrowing capacity $4,000 $500Amount outstanding as of March 31, 2013 $832 $408Letters of credit outstanding as of March 31, 2013 $31 $— ___________________________________________(a)Co-borrowers are Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C. and Chesapeake Louisiana, L.P.(b)Borrower is COO.Our credit facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants. Although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, our credit facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the respective facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Corporate Credit Facility. Our $4.0 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the facility are secured by proved reserves and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank, N.A. or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on LIBOR, plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. These margins may be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit facility amendment discussed below. The collateral value and borrowing base are determined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals.The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens and require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, in each case as defined in the agreement. In September 2012, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility agreement, effective September 30, 2012. See Risks and Uncertainties in Note 1 for further discussion. The amendment, among other things, adjusts our required indebtedness to EBITDA ratio as set forth below through the earlier of (i) December 31, 2013 and (ii) the date on which we elect to reinstate the indebtedness to EBITDA ratio in effect prior to the amendment (in either case, the “Amendment Effective Period”). The amendment increased the maximum indebtedness to EBITDA ratio as of September 30, 2012 from 4.00 to 1.00 to 6.00 to 1.00 and revises the required ratio for the next four quarters as shown below. The ratio returns to 4.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2013 and thereafter. Effective Date AmendedIndebtedness to EBITDA RatioDecember 31, 2012 5.00 to 1.00March 31, 2013 4.75 to 1.00June 30, 2013 4.50 to 1.00September 30, 2013 4.25 to 1.00The credit facility amendment increases the applicable margin by 0.25% for borrowings under the corporate credit facility on each day during the Amendment Effective Period when credit extensions exceed 50% of the borrowing capacity and requires us to pay a fee to each lender in an amount equal to 0.05% of its revolving commitment in the event that the Amendment Effective Period is in effect on June 30, 2013. Based on current commitment levels, this would result in an additional payment of $2 million. The amendment does not allow our collateral value securing the borrowings to be more than $75 million below the collateral value that was in effect as of September 30, 2012 during the Amendment Effective Period. We were in compliance with all covenants under the amended agreement as of March 31, 2013. The facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by Chesapeake and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. If we should fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $50 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note and contingent convertible senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of such indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to our secured hedging facility, equipment master lease agreements, term loan and other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $125 million. In addition, the facility contains a restriction on our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common or preferred stock if an event of default has occurred.Oilfield Services Credit Facility. Our $500 million syndicated oilfield services revolving bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes associated with our oilfield services operations. Borrowings under the oilfield services credit facility are secured by all of the assets of the wholly owned subsidiaries of COO, itself an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake. The facility has initial commitments of $500 million and may be expanded to $900 million at COO’s option, subject to additional bank participation. Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all of the equity interests and assets of COO and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the restricted subsidiaries for this facility, which are unrestricted subsidiaries under Chesapeake’s senior notes, contingent convertible senior notes, term loan and corporate revolving bank credit facility), and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Bank of America, N.A., the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which are subject to a margin that varies from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The unused portion of the credit facility is subject to a commitment fee that varies from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum. Both margins and commitment fees are determined according to the most recent leverage ratio described below. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals.The oilfield services credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit the ability of COO and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The agreement requires maintenance of a leverage ratio based on the ratio of lease adjusted indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (EBITDAR), a senior secured leverage ratio based on the ratio of secured indebtedness to EBITDA and a fixed charge coverage ratio based on the ratio of EBITDAR to lease adjusted interest expense, in each case as defined in the agreement. COO was in compliance with all covenants under the agreement as of March 31, 2013. If COO or its restricted subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under the agreement, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $50 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our COO senior note indenture, which could in turn result in the acceleration of the COO senior note indebtedness. The oilfield services credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness COO and its restricted subsidiaries may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $15 million.Midstream Credit Facility. Prior to June 15, 2012, we utilized a $600 million syndicated senior secured revolving bank credit facility to fund capital expenditures to build natural gas gathering and other systems in support of our drilling program and for general corporate purposes associated with our midstream operations. With the sale of a substantial portion of our midstream business in the second half of 2012, on June 15, 2012, we paid off and terminated our midstream credit facility.\n",

(b)In the Current Quarter, we completed a tender offer for and redemption of the 9.5% Senior Notes due 2015.(c)The principal amount shown is based on the exchange rate of $1.3692 to €1.00 and $1.3743 to €1.00 as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. See Note 9 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives.(d)In the Current Quarter, we redeemed all outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018. (e)Initial issuers were COO and Chesapeake Oilfield Finance, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of COO. Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the issuer of all other senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes. In the Current Quarter, in connection with the spin-off of our oilfield services business, the obligations with respect to the COO senior notes were removed from our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014. See Note 2 for further discussion of the spin-off. (f)The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. In the second quarter of 2014, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the third quarter of 2014 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision in the Current Quarter or the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of such principal amount. Under certain conditions, we will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years. We may redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. The optional repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to the dividend of SSE common stock paid in the spin-off of our oilfield services business and cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 $45.22 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $59.71 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $100.45 June 14, 2019(g)In the Current Quarter, in connection with the spin-off of our oilfield services business, we terminated our oilfield services credit facility. See Note 2 for further discussion of the spin-off.(h)Discount as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 included $264 million and $303 million, respectively, associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible senior notes. This discount is amortized based on an effective yield method. Discount also included $33 million as of December 31, 2013 associated with our term loan discussed further below.(i)See Note 9 for further discussion related to these instruments.Term LoanIn November 2012, we established an unsecured five-year term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion for net proceeds of $1.935 billion. The term loan provided that it could be voluntarily repaid before November 9, 2015 at par plus a specified premium and at any time thereafter at par. The maturity date of the term loan was December 2, 2017. In the Current Quarter, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from its offering of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes to repay the borrowings under, and terminate, the term loan. We recorded a loss of $90 million, consisting of $40 million in premiums, $30 million of unamortized discount and $20 million of unamortized deferred charges, in connection with the termination.Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesThe Chesapeake senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries. See Note 18 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The indentures governing the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes do not have any financial or restricted payment covenants. The senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes indentures have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness the Company or any guarantor subsidiary may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of at least $50 million or $75 million, depending on the indenture.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. The applicable rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.During the Current Quarter, we issued $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes at par. The offering included two series of notes: $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2019 and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022. We used a portion of the net proceeds of $2.966 billion to repay the borrowings under, and terminate, our term loan credit facility. We used the remaining proceeds along with cash on hand to redeem the remaining $97 million principal amount of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 and to purchase and redeem the remaining $1.265 billion principal amount of the 9.5% Senior Notes due 2015 for $1.454 billion. We recorded a loss of approximately $6 million associated with the redemption of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018, which consisted of $5 million in premiums and $1 million of unamortized deferred charges. We recorded a loss of approximately $99 million associated with the purchase and redemption of the 9.5% Senior Notes due 2015, which consisted of $87 million in premiums, $9 million of unamortized discount and $3 million of unamortized deferred charges. During the Prior Period, we issued $2.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes at par. The offering included three series of notes: $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016; $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2021; and $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2023. We used a portion of the net proceeds of $2.274 billion to repay outstanding indebtedness under our corporate revolving bank credit facility and purchase certain senior notes. We purchased $217 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013 for $221 million and $377 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 for $405 million pursuant to tender offers during the Prior Period. We recorded a loss of approximately $37 million associated with the tender offers, including $32 million in premiums and $5 million of unamortized deferred charges. During the Prior Period, we also redeemed $1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) at par pursuant to notice of special early redemption. We recorded a loss of approximately $33 million associated with the redemption, including $19 million of unamortized deferred charges and $14 million of discount. As described in the following paragraph, our redemption of the 2019 notes has been the subject of litigation. On July 15, 2013, we retired at maturity the remaining $247 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013. In March 2013, the Company brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Court”) against The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (“BNY Mellon”), the indenture trustee for the 2019 Notes. The Company sought a declaration that the notice it issued to redeem all of the 2019 Notes at par (plus accrued interest through the redemption date) was timely and effective pursuant to the special early redemption provision of the supplemental indenture governing the 2019 Notes. BNY Mellon asserted that the notice was not effective to redeem the 2019 Notes at par because it was not timely for that purpose and because of the specific phrasing in the notice that provided it would not be effective unless the Court concluded it was timely. The Court conducted a trial on the matter and ruled in the Company’s favor in May 2013. BNY Mellon filed notice of an appeal of the decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the appeal is currently pending. No scheduled principal payments are required on our senior notes until 2016.Bank Credit FacilitiesDuring the Current Period, we had the following two revolving bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity: CorporateCredit Facility(a) Oilfield ServicesCredit Facility(b) ($ in millions)Facility structure Senior securedrevolving Senior securedrevolvingMaturity date December 2015 November 2016Borrowing capacity $4,000 $500Amount outstanding as of June 30, 2014 $— $—Letters of credit outstanding as of June 30, 2014 $20 $— ___________________________________________(a)Co-borrowers are Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C. and Chesapeake Louisiana, L.P.(b)Borrower was COO. We terminated our oilfield services credit facility in the Current Quarter in connection with the spin-off of our oilfield services business. See Note 2 for further discussion of the spin-off.Our $4.0 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the facility are secured by proved reserves and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank, N.A. or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on LIBOR, plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are determined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. Although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, our credit facility does not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facility or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Our corporate credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens and require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, in each case as defined in the agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants under our corporate credit facility agreement as of June 30, 2014. Our corporate credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by Chesapeake and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. If we should fail to perform our obligations under the credit facility agreement, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $50 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note and contingent convertible senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of such indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to our secured hedging facility, equipment master lease agreements and other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $125 million. In addition, the facility contains a restriction on our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common or preferred stock if an event of default has occurred.Spin-Off Debt TransactionsPrior to the spin-off of our oilfield services business, COO or its subsidiaries completed the following debt transactions:•Entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with total commitments of $275 million and incurred approximately $3 million in financing costs related to entering into the facility.•Entered into a $400 million seven-year secured term loan and used the net proceeds of approximately $394 million and borrowings under the new revolving credit facility to repay and terminate COO’s existing credit facility.•Issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Senior Notes due 2022 in a private placement and used the net proceeds of approximately $494 million to make a cash distribution of approximately $391 million to us, to repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the new revolving credit facility discussed above and for general corporate purposes.All deferred charges and debt balances related to these transactions were removed from our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014. See Note 2 for further discussion of the spin-off.Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our exchange-traded debt using quoted market prices (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt, which consists of our credit facility and term loan, is estimated using our credit default swap rate (Level 2).

(b)In the Current Period, we completed a tender offer for and redemption of the 9.5% Senior Notes due 2015.(c)The principal amount shown is based on the exchange rate of $1.2631 to €1.00 and $1.3743 to €1.00 as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. See Note 9 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives.(d)In the Current Period, we redeemed all outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018. (e)Initial issuers were COO and Chesapeake Oilfield Finance, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of COO. Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the issuer of all other senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes. In the Current Period, in connection with the spin-off of our oilfield services business, the obligations with respect to the COO senior notes were removed from our condensed consolidated balance sheet. See Note 2 for further discussion of the spin-off. (f)The repurchase, conversion, contingent interest and redemption provisions of our contingent convertible senior notes are as follows:Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. Optional Conversion by Holders. At the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the third quarter of 2014, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the fourth quarter of 2014 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision in the Current Quarter or the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of such principal amount.Contingent Interest. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years during certain periods if the average trading price of the notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture.The holders’ demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to the dividend of SSE common stock paid in the spin-off of our oilfield services business and cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Holders' Demand Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 $45.22 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $59.71 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $100.45 June 14, 2019Optional Redemption by the Company. We may redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash.(g)In the Current Period, in connection with the spin-off of our oilfield services business, we terminated our oilfield services credit facility. See Note 2 for further discussion of the spin-off.(h)Discount as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 included $244 million and $303 million, respectively, associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible senior notes. This discount is amortized based on an effective yield method. Discount also included $33 million as of December 31, 2013 associated with our term loan discussed below.(i)See Note 9 for further discussion related to these instruments.Term LoanIn November 2012, we established an unsecured five-year term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion for net proceeds of $1.935 billion. The term loan provided that it could be voluntarily repaid before November 9, 2015 at par plus a specified premium and at any time thereafter at par. The maturity date of the term loan was December 2, 2017. In the Current Period, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our offering of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes to repay the borrowings under, and terminate, the term loan. We recorded a loss of $90 million, consisting of $40 million in premiums, $30 million of unamortized discount and $20 million of unamortized deferred charges, in connection with the termination.Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesThe Chesapeake senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries. See Note 18 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The indentures governing the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes do not have any financial or restricted payment covenants. The senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes indentures have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness the Company or any guarantor subsidiary may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of at least $50 million or $75 million, depending on the indenture.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. The applicable rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.During the Current Period, we issued $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes at par. The offering included two series of notes: $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2019 and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022. We used a portion of the net proceeds of $2.966 billion to repay the borrowings under, and terminate, our term loan credit facility. We used the remaining proceeds along with cash on hand to redeem the remaining $97 million principal amount of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 and to purchase and redeem the remaining $1.265 billion principal amount of the 9.5% Senior Notes due 2015 for $1.454 billion. We recorded a loss of approximately $6 million associated with the redemption of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018, which consisted of $5 million in premiums and $1 million of unamortized deferred charges. We recorded a loss of approximately $99 million associated with the purchase and redemption of the 9.5% Senior Notes due 2015, which consisted of $87 million in premiums, $9 million of unamortized discount and $3 million of unamortized deferred charges. During the Prior Period, we issued $2.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes at par. The offering included three series of notes: $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016; $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2021; and $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2023. We used a portion of the net proceeds of $2.274 billion to repay outstanding indebtedness under our corporate revolving bank credit facility and purchase certain senior notes. We purchased $217 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013 for $221 million and $377 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 for $405 million pursuant to tender offers during the Prior Period. We recorded a loss of approximately $37 million associated with the tender offers, including $32 million in premiums and $5 million of unamortized deferred charges. During the Prior Period, we also redeemed $1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes) at par pursuant to notice of special early redemption. We recorded a loss of approximately $33 million associated with the redemption, including $19 million of unamortized deferred charges and $14 million of discount. As described in the following paragraph, our redemption of the 2019 notes has been the subject of litigation. On July 15, 2013, we retired at maturity the remaining $247 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013. In March 2013, the Company brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court) against The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (BNY Mellon), the indenture trustee for the 2019 Notes. The Company sought a declaration that the notice it issued to redeem all of the 2019 Notes at par (plus accrued interest through the redemption date) was timely and effective pursuant to the special early redemption provision of the supplemental indenture governing the 2019 Notes. BNY Mellon asserted that the notice was not effective to redeem the 2019 Notes at par because it was not timely for that purpose and because of the specific phrasing in the notice that provided it would not be effective unless the Court concluded it was timely. The Court conducted a trial on the matter and ruled in the Company’s favor in May 2013. BNY Mellon filed notice of an appeal of the decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the appeal is currently pending. No scheduled principal payments are required on our senior notes until 2016 unless the holders of our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on November 15, 2015, which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the $396 million principal amount of notes.Corporate Credit FacilityWe have a $4.0 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility that matures in December 2015. Our subsidiaries Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C. and Chesapeake Louisiana, L.P. are borrowers under the facility. As of September 30, 2014, we had $59 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility and utilized $15 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are secured by proved reserves and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank, N.A. or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on LIBOR, plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are determined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, may be payable at more frequent intervals. Although the applicable interest rates under the facility fluctuate based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, the facility does not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facility or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Our corporate credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens and require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, in each case as defined in the agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants under our corporate credit facility agreement as of September 30, 2014. Our corporate credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by Chesapeake and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. If we should fail to perform our obligations under the credit facility agreement, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $50 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note and contingent convertible senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of such indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to our secured hedging facility and other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $125 million. In addition, the facility contains a restriction on our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common or preferred stock if an event of default has occurred.Spin-Off Debt TransactionsPrior to the spin-off of our oilfield services business, COO or its subsidiaries completed the following debt transactions:•Entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with total commitments of $275 million and incurred approximately $3 million in financing costs related to entering into the facility.•Entered into a $400 million seven-year secured term loan and used the net proceeds of approximately $394 million and borrowings under the new revolving credit facility to repay and terminate COO’s existing credit facility.•Issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Senior Notes due 2022 in a private placement and used the net proceeds of approximately $494 million to make a cash distribution of approximately $391 million to us, to repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the new revolving credit facility discussed above and for general corporate purposes.All deferred charges and debt balances related to these transactions were removed from our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014. See Note 2 for further discussion of the spin-off.Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our exchange-traded debt using quoted market prices (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt, which currently consists of our corporate credit facility and as of December 31, 2013 also consisted of our former oilfield services credit facility and term loan, is estimated using our credit default swap rate (Level 2).

One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the first quarter of 2015, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the second quarter of 2015 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter or the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Contingent Interest.

As discussed in footnote (b) above, the holders of our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 could exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on November 15, 2015, which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes. As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there was $11 million and $15 million, respectively, of discount associated with the equity component of the 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035. Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesThe Chesapeake senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake is a holding company, owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries. See Note 17 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The indentures governing the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes do not have any financial or restricted payment covenants. The senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes indentures have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness the Company or any guarantor subsidiary may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of at least $50 million or $75 million, depending on the indenture.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. The applicable rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.In March 2013, the Company brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the indenture trustee for the 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). The Company sought and ultimately obtained a judgment declaring that the notice it issued on March 15, 2013 to redeem all of the 2019 Notes at par (plus accrued interest through the redemption date) was timely and effective for that redemption pursuant to the special early redemption provision of the supplemental indenture governing the 2019 Notes. In May 2013, as a result of that ruling, the 2019 Notes were redeemed at par. In November 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, on appeal by the indenture trustee, reversed the District Court’s declaratory judgment and held that the notice was not effective to redeem the 2019 Notes at par because it was not timely for that purpose. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for a determination whether the redemption notice triggered a redemption at the make-whole price specified in the indenture, instead of at par. The Company sought a rehearing by the Court of Appeals en banc in December 2014, and that petition was denied on February 6, 2015. On February 13, 2015, the indenture trustee moved the District Court for entry of a judgment requiring the Company to pay the make-whole price, as defined in the indenture, less the par amount paid in the 2013 redemption plus prejudgment interest from the redemption date. On March 20, 2015, the Company filed its opposition to the Trustee’s motion and cross-moved for a judgment requiring the Company to pay restitution in an amount that would disgorge the benefit the Company achieved from refinancing the 2019 Notes in 2013 and that would return the parties to the economic positions they would have been in if the par redemption had never taken place. The District Court held argument on the motion and cross-motion on May 1, 2015. The District Court had not ruled as of May 5, 2015.On December 30, 2014, six former holders of the 2019 Notes filed a putative class action against the Company on behalf of all former holders who purchased their 2019 Notes before the Company issued its notice of special early redemption at par in March 2013 and sold their 2019 Notes after the Company issued the early redemption notice but before the notes were redeemed at par in May 2013. The plaintiffs alleged that the Company breached the indenture in connection with its special early par redemption, causing the market value of the notes to decline and injuring the class members when they sold their 2019 Notes. The plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint on March 2, 2015 and subsequently entered into a stipulation by which the action was dismissed with prejudice and without costs on March 16, 2015. No scheduled principal payments are required on our senior notes until 2016 unless the holders of our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on November 15, 2015, which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the $396 million principal amount of notes.Revolving Credit FacilityIn December 2014, we entered into a five-year $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility to use for general corporate purposes. The credit facility replaced our then-existing $4.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in December 2015. The aggregate commitments under the facility may be increased up to an additional $1.0 billion, and the December 2019 maturity date may be extended for two one-year periods at our request and with the consent of the participating lenders. As of March 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility and utilized $15 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are currently unsecured; however, we will be required to provide collateral and the facility will be subject to a borrowing base if our credit rating declines to Ba3 (Moody’s Investors Services, Inc.) or BB- (Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services) or lower. Revolving loans under the credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the administrative agent’s prime rate or (iii) the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR) for a one-month interest period plus 1.0% (alternative base rate (ABR) loans), and/or LIBOR rates (LIBOR loans), at our election, plus an applicable margin rate depending on our credit rating (currently 0.625% per annum for ABR loans and 1.625% per annum for LIBOR loans). The terms of the credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (i) a net debt to capitalization ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) that does not exceed 65%; and (ii) a leverage ratio (net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement) that does not exceed 4.0 to 1.0; provided, however, that the leverage ratio will not apply during any period in which our credit rating, as determined by either Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, meets certain investment grade thresholds, as defined in the credit agreement.Our credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain of our material subsidiaries. The credit agreement includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect; cross-payment default and cross acceleration with respect to indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of $125 million or more; bankruptcy; judgments involving liability of $125 million or more that are not paid; and ERISA events. Many events of default are subject to customary notice and cure periods.Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our exchange-traded debt using quoted market prices (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt, which would include borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which was undrawn as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014), is estimated using our credit default swap rate (Level 2). Fair value is compared to the carrying value, excluding the impact of interest rate derivatives, in the table below.

See Note 8 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives.(b)The repurchase, conversion, contingent interest and redemption provisions of our contingent convertible senior notes are as follows:Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The holders of our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 could exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on November 15, 2015, which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes.Optional Conversion by Holders. At the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the second quarter of 2015, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the third quarter of 2015 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter or the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Contingent Interest. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years during certain periods if the average trading price of the notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture.The holders’ demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Holders' Demand Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 $45.14 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $59.44 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $100.35 June 14, 2019Optional Redemption by the Company.

This discount is amortized based on an effective yield method. (d)See Note 8 for further discussion related to these instruments.(e)As of June 30, 2015, current maturities of long-term debt, net includes the carrying amount of our 3.25% Senior Notes due March 2016 and 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035. As discussed in footnote (b) above, the holders of our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 could exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on November 15, 2015, which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, current maturities of long-term debt, net reflects $7 million and $15 million, respectively, of discount associated with the equity component of the 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035. Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesThe Chesapeake senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake is a holding company, owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries. See Note 18 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The indentures governing the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes do not have any financial or restricted payment covenants. The senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes indentures have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness the Company or any guarantor subsidiary may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of at least $50 million or $75 million, depending on the indenture.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. The applicable rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.In March 2013, the Company brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the indenture trustee for the 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). The Company sought and ultimately obtained a judgment declaring that the notice it issued on March 15, 2013 to redeem all of the 2019 Notes at par (plus accrued interest through the redemption date) was timely and effective for that redemption pursuant to the special early redemption provision of the supplemental indenture governing the 2019 Notes. In May 2013, as a result of that ruling, the 2019 Notes were redeemed at par. In November 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, on appeal by the indenture trustee, reversed the District Court’s declaratory judgment and held that the notice was not effective to redeem the 2019 Notes at par because it was not timely for that purpose. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for a determination whether the redemption notice triggered a redemption at the make-whole price specified in the indenture, instead of at par. The Company sought a rehearing by the Court of Appeals en banc in December 2014, and that petition was denied on February 6, 2015. On February 13, 2015, the indenture trustee moved the District Court for entry of a judgment requiring the Company to pay the make-whole price, as defined in the indenture, less the par amount paid in the 2013 redemption plus prejudgment interest from the redemption date. On March 20, 2015, the Company filed its opposition to the Trustee’s motion and cross-moved for a judgment requiring the Company to pay restitution in an amount that would disgorge the benefit the Company achieved from refinancing the 2019 Notes in 2013 and that would return the parties to the economic positions they would have been in if the par redemption had never taken place. The District Court held argument on the motion and cross-motion on May 1, 2015. On July 10, 2015, the District Court granted the Trustee’s motion and denied the Company’s cross-motion and entered an amended judgment on July 17, 2015 awarding the Trustee $380 million plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $59 million. The Company filed a notice of appeal on July 27, 2015 and posted a supersedeas bond to stay execution of the judgment while appellate proceedings are pending.Revolving Credit FacilityIn December 2014, we entered into a five-year $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility to use for general corporate purposes. The credit facility replaced our then-existing $4.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility. The aggregate commitments under the facility may be increased up to an additional $1.0 billion, and the December 2019 maturity date may be extended for two one-year periods at our request and with the consent of the participating lenders. As of June 30, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility and utilized $15 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are currently unsecured; however, we will be required to provide collateral and the facility will be subject to a borrowing base if our credit rating declines to Ba3 (Moody’s Investors Services, Inc.) or BB- (Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services) or lower. Revolving loans under the credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the administrative agent’s prime rate or (iii) the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR) for a one-month interest period plus 1.0% (alternative base rate (ABR) loans), and/or LIBOR rates (LIBOR loans), at our election, plus an applicable margin rate depending on our credit rating (currently 0.625% per annum for ABR loans and 1.625% per annum for LIBOR loans). The terms of the credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (i) a net debt to capitalization ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) that does not exceed 65%; and (ii) a leverage ratio (net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement) that does not exceed 4.0 to 1.0; provided, however, that the leverage ratio will not apply during any period in which our credit rating, as determined by either Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, meets certain investment grade thresholds, as defined in the credit agreement.Our credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain of our material subsidiaries. The credit agreement includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect; cross-payment default and cross acceleration with respect to indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of $125 million or more; bankruptcy; judgments involving liability of $125 million or more that are not paid; and ERISA events. Many events of default are subject to customary notice and cure periods.Spin-Off Debt TransactionsOn June 30, 2014, we completed the spin-off of our oilfield services business, which we previously conducted through our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary Chesapeake Oilfield Operating, L.L.C. (COO), into an independent, publicly traded company called Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (SSE). In the Prior Quarter, COO or its subsidiaries completed the following debt transactions:•Entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with total commitments of $275 million and incurred approximately $3 million in financing costs related to entering into the facility.•Entered into a $400 million seven-year secured term loan and used the net proceeds of approximately $394 million and borrowings under the new revolving credit facility to repay and terminate COO’s then-existing credit facility.•Issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Senior Notes due 2022 in a private placement and used the net proceeds of approximately $494 million to make a cash distribution of approximately $391 million to us, to repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the new revolving credit facility discussed above and for general corporate purposes.All deferred charges and debt balances related to these transactions were removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014. See Note 14 for further discussion of the spin-off.Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our exchange-traded debt using quoted market prices (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt, which would include borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which was undrawn as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014), is estimated using our credit default swap rate (Level 2).

See Foreign Currency Derivatives in Note 8 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives.(b)The repurchase, conversion, contingent interest and redemption provisions of our contingent convertible senior notes are as follows:Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The first put date, for the 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the 2035 Notes), is November 15, 2015. As required by the terms of the indenture for the 2035 Notes, on October 1, 2015, we issued a notice to the holders of the 2035 Notes allowing each holder an opportunity to require us to repurchase some or all of its notes on November 15, 2015. As a result, we may be required to repurchase some or all of the 2035 Notes outstanding on November 15, 2015.Optional Conversion by Holders. At the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the third quarter of 2015, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the fourth quarter of 2015 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter or the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Contingent Interest. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years during certain periods if the average trading price of the notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture.The holders’ demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Holders' Demand Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 $45.14 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $59.44 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $100.35 June 14, 2019Optional Redemption by the Company.

As discussed in footnote (b) above, the holders of our 2035 Notes could exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on November 15, 2015, which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, current maturities of long-term debt, net reflects $3 million and $15 million, respectively, of discount associated with the equity component of the 2035 Notes.Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesThe Chesapeake senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. As a holding company, Chesapeake owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries. See Note 19 for condensed consolidating financial information regarding our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our senior notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The indentures governing the senior notes and the contingent convertible senior notes do not have any financial or restricted payment covenants. Indentures for the senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes have cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness the Company or any guarantor subsidiary may have from time to time with an outstanding principal amount of at least $50 million or $75 million, depending on the indenture.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. The applicable rates for our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 are 6.86%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.In March 2013, the Company brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the indenture trustee for the 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). The Company sought and ultimately obtained a judgment declaring that the notice it issued on March 15, 2013 to redeem all of the 2019 Notes at par (plus accrued interest through the redemption date) was timely and effective for that redemption pursuant to the special early redemption provision of the supplemental indenture governing the 2019 Notes.

On March 20, 2015, the Company filed its opposition to the Trustee’s motion and cross-moved for a judgment requiring the Company to pay restitution in an amount that would disgorge the benefit the Company achieved from refinancing the 2019 Notes in 2013 and that would return the parties to the economic positions they would have been in if the par redemption had never taken place. On July 10, 2015, the District Court granted the Trustee’s motion and denied the Company’s cross-motion and entered an amended judgment on July 17, 2015 awarding the Trustee $380 million plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $59 million. The Company filed a notice of appeal on July 27, 2015 and posted a supersedeas bond to stay execution of the judgment while appellate proceedings are pending.Revolving Credit FacilityOn September 30, 2015, we entered into an amendment to our $4.0 billion senior revolving credit facility dated December 15, 2014 and maturing December 2019, which is used for general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the amended credit agreement, we are required to secure our obligations under the facility and certain hedging agreements with liens on certain of our oil and natural gas properties, with such liens to be released upon the satisfaction of specific conditions. The amended credit facility provides that, while the obligations are required to be secured, (i) we have the right to incur junior lien indebtedness of up to $2.0 billion; (ii) our use of the facility will be subject to a borrowing base; (iii) the rate of interest on outstanding loans, as well as fees on undrawn commitments, will vary based on the percentage of the borrowing base used, rather than on our credit ratings; (iv) the total leverage ratio covenant will be suspended; and (v) the credit facility will be subject to a first lien secured leverage ratio and an interest rate coverage ratio (as described below). The amendment sets the borrowing base at $4.0 billion. The total commitments under the credit facility remain at $4.0 billion, subject to reduction in connection with issuances of junior lien indebtedness by us after April 15, 2016, the date of the first borrowing base redetermination. No adjustment to the total commitment will occur for any junior lien indebtedness issuance that occurs before April 15, 2016. As of September 30, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility and had used $12 million of the facility for various letters of credit.While obligations under our credit facility are required to be secured, revolving loans under the amended credit facility will bear interest, at our election, at either (i) a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (b) the administrative agent’s prime rate or (c) the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR) for a one-month interest period plus 1.0% (alternative base rate (ABR) loans), or (ii) a LIBOR rate (LIBOR loans), in each case plus a margin based on the percentage of the borrowing base used (currently 1.0% per annum for ABR loans and 2.0% per annum for LIBOR loans). The terms of the credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates, together with a requirement that we maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a net debt to capitalization ratio (as defined in the amended credit agreement) that does not exceed 65%. While it is required to be secured by a portion of our oil and natural gas properties, the amended credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (i) a first lien secured leverage ratio (as defined in the amended credit agreement) of 3.5 to 1.0 through 2017 and 3.0 to 1.0 thereafter, and (ii) an interest rate coverage ratio (as defined in the amended credit agreement) of 1.1 to 1.0 through the first quarter of 2017, increasing to 1.25 to 1.0 by the end of 2017. Our credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain of our material subsidiaries. The amended credit agreement includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect; cross-payment default and cross acceleration with respect to indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of $125 million or more; bankruptcy; judgments involving liability of $125 million or more that are not paid; and ERISA events. Many events of default are subject to customary notice and cure periods.Spin-Off Debt TransactionsOn June 30, 2014, we completed the spin-off of our oilfield services business, which we previously conducted through our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary Chesapeake Oilfield Operating, L.L.C. (COO), into the independent, publicly traded company Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (SSE). In the Prior Period, COO or its subsidiaries completed the following debt transactions:•Entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with total commitments of $275 million and incurred approximately $3 million in financing costs related to entering into the facility.•Entered into a $400 million seven-year secured term loan and used the net proceeds of approximately $394 million and borrowings under the new revolving credit facility to repay and terminate COO’s then-existing credit facility.•Issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Senior Notes due 2022 in a private placement and used the net proceeds of approximately $494 million to make a cash distribution of approximately $391 million to us, to repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the new revolving credit facility discussed above and for general corporate purposes.All deferred charges and debt balances related to these transactions were removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014. See Note 15 for further discussion of the spin-off.Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our exchange-traded debt using quoted market prices (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt, which would include borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which was undrawn as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014), is estimated using our credit default swap rate (Level 2). Fair value is compared to the carrying value, excluding the impact of interest rate derivatives, in the table below.

See Foreign Currency Derivatives in Note 8 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives. (b)The repurchase, conversion, contingent interest and redemption provisions of our contingent convertible senior notes are as follows:Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date.Optional Conversion by Holders. At the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the Current Quarter, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the second quarter of 2016 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Contingent Interest. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years during certain periods if the average trading price of the notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture.The holders’ demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Holders' Demand Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2020, 2025, 2030 $45.02 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $59.44 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $100.20 June 14, 2019Optional Redemption by the Company. We may redeem the contingent convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. We may redeem our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 at any time.(c)Discount as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included $103 million and $133 million, respectively, associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible senior notes. This discount is amortized based on an effective yield method.(d)See Interest Rate Derivatives in Note 8 for further discussion related to these instruments.(e)As of March 31, 2016, current maturities of long-term debt, net includes our 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017.Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesIn the Current Quarter, in addition to the repayment upon maturity of $259 million principal amount of our 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016 (together with $122 million principal amount repurchased in the open market for $115 million prior to maturity), we repurchased in the open market approximately $118 million principal amount of our outstanding 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (that could have been put to us in May 2017) for $63 million and $59 million principal amount of our outstanding 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 for $36 million. Additionally, we privately negotiated an exchange of approximately $90 million principal amount of our outstanding 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 for 14,699,368 common shares and $15 million principal amount of our outstanding 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 for 2,555,979 common shares. We recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $100 million associated with the repurchases and exchanges.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a $4.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019. As of March 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $367 million under the credit facility and had used $619 million of the credit facility for various letters of credit (including the $461 million supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation discussed in Note 4). The terms of the credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the agreement as of March 31, 2016.In April 2016, we entered into the third amendment to our senior revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the amendment, our borrowing base was reaffirmed in the amount of $4.0 billion and the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination review was postponed until June 15, 2017, with the consenting lenders agreeing not to exercise their interim redetermination right prior to that date. The amendment also provides temporary financial covenant relief, with the credit facility’s existing first lien secured leverage ratio and net debt to capitalization ratio suspended until September 30, 2017 and the interest coverage ratio maintenance covenant was reduced as noted below. In addition, we agreed to grant liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets, as well as maintain a minimum liquidity amount (defined as cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility) of $500 million until the suspension of the existing maintenance covenants ends. The amendment reduces the interest coverage ratio from 1.1 to 1.0 to 0.65 to 1.0 through the first quarter of 2017, after which it will increase to 0.70 to 1.0 through the second quarter of 2017, 1.2 to 1.0 through the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25 to 1.0 thereafter. The amendment also includes a collateral value coverage test whereby if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of December 31, 2016, falls below 1.1 to 1.0, the $500 million minimum liquidity covenant increases to $750 million, and if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of March 31, 2017, falls below 1.25 to 1.0, our borrowing ability will be reduced in order to satisfy such ratio. The amendment also gives us the ability to incur up to $2.5 billion of first lien indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the existing obligations under the credit agreement, subject to payment priority in favor of the existing lenders and the other limitations on junior lien debt set forth in the credit agreement. Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our exchange-traded debt using quoted market prices (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, is estimated using our credit default swap rate (Level 2).

During the specified period in the Current Quarter, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the third quarter of 2016 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Contingent Interest.

Additionally, we privately negotiated exchanges of approximately $290 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for 53,923,925 shares of common stock and $287 million principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for 55,427,782 shares of common stock. In the Current Period, we recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $168 million associated with the repurchases and exchanges (including $68 million in the Current Quarter). Chesapeake Energy Corporation is a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Our obligations under our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are minor and, as such, we have not included condensed consolidating financial information.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a $4.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019.

The amendment reduces the interest coverage ratio from 1.1 to 1.0 to 0.65 to 1.0 through the first quarter of 2017, after which it will increase to 0.70 to 1.0 through the second quarter of 2017, 1.2 to 1.0 through the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25 to 1.0 thereafter.

At the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the Current Quarter, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the fourth quarter of 2016 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Contingent Interest. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years during certain periods if the average trading price of the notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture.The holders’ demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Holders' Demand Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2020, 2025, 2030 $45.02 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $59.44 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $100.20 June 14, 2019Optional Redemption by the Company. We may redeem the contingent convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. In addition, we may redeem our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 at any time.(c)The carrying amount associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible senior notes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is net of $28 million and $133 million, respectively. This amount is amortized based on an effective yield method.(d)See Interest Rate Derivatives in Note 8 for further discussion related to these instruments.(e)As of September 30, 2016, current maturities of long-term debt, net includes our 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017, 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 and our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (2037 Notes). As discussed in footnote (b) above, the holders of our 2037 Notes could exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on May 15, 2017, which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes. As of September 30, 2016, there was $5 million associated with the equity component of the 2037 Notes.Term Loan FacilityIn the Current Quarter, we entered into a secured five-year term loan facility in aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion for net proceeds of approximately $1.482 billion. Our obligations under the new facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our revolving credit facility and are secured by first-priority liens on the same collateral securing our revolving credit facility (with a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall junior to the revolving credit facility). The term loan bears interest at a rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 7.50% per annum, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor, or the Alternative Base Rate (ABR) plus 6.50% per annum, subject to a 2.00% ABR floor, at our option. The loan was made at par without original discount. We used the net proceeds to finance tender offers for our unsecured notes. The term loan matures in August 2021 and is subject to a make-whole premium prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the term loan, a premium to par of 4.25% from the second anniversary until but excluding the third anniversary, a premium to par of 2.125% from the third anniversary until but excluding the fourth anniversary and at par beginning on the fourth anniversary. The term loan may be subject to mandatory prepayments and offers to prepay with net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, certain sales and other dispositions of collateral. The term loan contains covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, sell collateral and use proceeds from such sales, make investments, repay certain subordinate, unsecured or junior lien indebtedness, and enter into transactions with affiliates.Events of default under the term loan include, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect; cross-payment default and cross acceleration with respect to other indebtedness with an outstanding principal balance of $125 million or more; bankruptcy; judgments involving liability of $125 million or more that are not paid; and ERISA events. Many events of default are subject to customary notice and cure periods. Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior NotesIn the Current Quarter, we used the net proceeds from our term loan discussed above to purchase and retire $898 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and $708 million principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for an aggregate $1.5 billion pursuant to tender offers. We recognized an aggregate gain of $87 million associated with these debt retirements, which was net of $25 million associated with the equity component of the retired contingent convertible senior notes. In the Current Period, in addition to these tender offers and the repayment upon maturity of $259 million principal amount of our 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately $181 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for $151 million and $118 million principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for $63 million. Additionally, we privately negotiated exchanges of approximately $290 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for 53,923,925 shares of common stock and $287 million principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for 55,427,782 shares of common stock. In the Current Period, we recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $255 million associated with the tender offers, debt repurchases and exchanges discussed above. Chesapeake Energy Corporation is a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Our obligations under our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are minor and, as such, we have not included condensed consolidating financial information.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a $4.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019. As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $240 million under the revolving credit facility and had used $709 million of the revolving credit facility for various letters of credit (including the $461 million supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation discussed in Note 4). The terms of the revolving credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. We were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the agreement as of September 30, 2016.In the Current Period, we entered into the third amendment to our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the amendment, our borrowing base was reaffirmed in the amount of $4.0 billion and the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination review was postponed until June 15, 2017, with the consenting lenders agreeing not to exercise their interim redetermination right prior to that date. Our borrowing base may be reduced if we dispose of a certain percentage of the value of the collateral securing the facility. As a result of asset sales discussed in Note 16 and all other sales of collateral since the date of the most recent amendment, as of October 31, 2016, our borrowing base was reduced to $3.8 billion. The amendment also provides temporary financial covenant relief, with the revolving credit facility’s existing first lien secured leverage ratio and net debt to capitalization ratio suspended until September 30, 2017 and the interest coverage ratio maintenance covenant reduced as noted below. In addition, we agreed to grant liens and security interests on a majority of our assets, as well as maintain a minimum liquidity amount (defined as cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility) of $500 million until the suspension of the existing maintenance covenants ends. The amendment reduces the interest coverage ratio from 1.1 to 1.0 to 0.65 to 1.0 through the first quarter of 2017, after which it will increase to 0.70 to 1.0 through the second quarter of 2017, 1.2 to 1.0 through the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25 to 1.0 thereafter. The amendment also includes a collateral value coverage test whereby if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of December 31, 2016, falls below 1.1 to 1.0, the $500 million minimum liquidity covenant increases to $750 million, and if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of March 31, 2017, falls below 1.25 to 1.0, our borrowing ability will be reduced in order to satisfy such ratio. The amendment also gives us the ability to incur up to $2.5 billion of first lien indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the existing obligations under the credit agreement, subject to a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall in favor of the revolving lenders and the other limitations on junior lien debt set forth in the credit agreement. After taking into account the term loan, the amount of additional first lien indebtedness permitted by the revolving credit facility is $1.0 billion. Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our senior notes using quoted market prices (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, is estimated using our credit default swap rate (Level 2). Fair value is compared to the carrying value, excluding the impact of interest rate derivatives, in the table below.

See Foreign Currency Derivatives in Note 8 for information on our related foreign currency derivatives.(b)The carrying amounts as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, include premium amounts of $949 million and $990 million, respectively, associated with a troubled debt restructuring. The premium is being amortized based on the effective yield method.(c)The conversion and redemption provisions of our convertible senior notes are as follows:Optional Conversion by Holders. Prior to maturity under certain circumstances and at the holder’s option, the notes are convertible into cash, our common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the first quarter of 2017, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes in the second quarter of 2017 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter. Upon conversion of a convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election, according to the conversion rate specified in the indenture.The common stock price conversion threshold amount for the convertible senior notes is 130% of the conversion price.Optional Redemption by the Company. We may redeem the convertible senior notes for cash on or after September 15, 2019, if the price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price during a specified period at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes.Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes upon certain fundamental changes.(d)The repurchase, conversion, contingent interest and redemption provisions of our contingent convertible senior notes are as follows:Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date and upon certain fundamental changes.Optional Conversion by Holders. At the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, our common stock using a net share settlement process. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period within a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the Current Quarter, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash or common stock in the second quarter of 2017 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Contingent Interest. We will pay contingent interest on the contingent convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years during certain periods if the average trading price of the notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture.The holders’ demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Holders' Demand Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable)2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2020, 2025, 2030 $45.02 May 14, 20162.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $59.44 November 14, 20172.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $100.20 June 14, 2019Optional Redemption by the Company.

In addition, we may redeem our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 at any time.(e)The carrying amounts as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, are reflected net of discounts of $433 million and $461 million, respectively, associated with the equity component of our convertible and contingent convertible senior notes. This amount is being amortized based on the effective yield method through the first demand repurchase date as applicable.(f)See Interest Rate Derivatives in Note 8 for further discussion related to these instruments.(g)As of March 31, 2017, current maturities of long-term debt, net includes our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (2037 Notes). As discussed in footnote (d) above, the holders of our 2037 Notes could exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on May 15, 2017, which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes.Term Loan FacilityWe have a secured five-year term loan facility in aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. Our obligations under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our revolving credit facility, second lien notes and senior notes and are secured by first-priority liens on the same collateral securing our revolving credit facility (with a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall junior to the revolving credit facility). The term loan bears interest at a rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 7.50% per annum, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor, or the Alternative Base Rate (ABR) plus 6.50% per annum, subject to a 2.00% ABR floor, at our option. The term loan matures in August 2021 and voluntary prepayments are subject to a make-whole premium prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the term loan, a premium to par of 4.25% from the second anniversary until but excluding the third anniversary, a premium to par of 2.125% from the third anniversary until but excluding the fourth anniversary and at par beginning on the fourth anniversary. The term loan may be subject to mandatory prepayments and offers to purchase with net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, certain asset sales and other dispositions of collateral and upon a change of control. Senior Secured Second Lien NotesOur second lien notes are secured second lien obligations and are effectively junior to our current and future secured first lien indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred under our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, effectively senior to all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness, including our outstanding senior notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral, and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur. We have the option to redeem the Second Lien Notes, in whole or in part, at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our second lien notes are governed by an indenture containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to create liens securing certain indebtedness, enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions, consolidate, merge or transfer assets and dispose of certain collateral and use proceeds from dispositions of certain collateral. As a holding company, Chesapeake owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the second lien notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. In December 2015, certain of the existing notes that were exchanged for the second lien notes were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). For the exchanges classified as a TDR, if the future undiscounted cash flows of the newly issued debt are less than the net carrying value of the original debt, a gain is recorded for the difference and the carrying value of the newly issued debt is adjusted to the future undiscounted cash flow amount and no future interest expense is recorded. All future interest payments on the newly issued debt reduce the carrying value. Senior Notes, Contingent Convertible Senior Notes and Convertible Senior NotesChesapeake Energy Corporation is a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Our obligations under our outstanding senior notes and convertible senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are minor and, as such, we have not included condensed consolidating financial information in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense through the first demand repurchase date, as applicable, at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. The applicable rates for our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037, our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 and our 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 are 8.0%, 8.0% and 11.5%, respectively.In the Current Quarter, we retired $908 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible notes through purchases in the open market, tender offers or repayment upon maturity for $982 million. Included in these retirements is the maturity of our 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017, which were carried at $258 million based on the December 31, 2016 exchange rate of $1.0517 to €1.00 and the corresponding cross currency swap. See Foreign Currency Derivatives in Note 8 for further information. For the open market repurchases and tender offers, we recorded an aggregate loss of approximately $7 million.In the Prior Quarter, we retired $558 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible notes through purchases in the open market, tender offers or repayment upon maturity for $472 million. Additionally, we privately negotiated an exchange of approximately $105 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes for 17,255,347 common shares. We recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $100 million associated with these repurchases and exchanges.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a $4.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019. As of March 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had used $697 million of the revolving credit facility for various letters of credit (including the $461 million supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation discussed in Note 4). As discussed in Note 4, on April 28, 2017, the Company paid $441 million as a result of the 2019 Notes litigation with cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the related supersedeas bond was released. The terms of the revolving credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. We were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the agreement as of March 31, 2017.During 2016, we entered into the third amendment to our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the amendment, our borrowing base was reaffirmed in the amount of $4.0 billion and the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination review was postponed until June 15, 2017, with the consenting lenders agreeing not to exercise their interim redetermination right prior to that date. As a result of certain asset sales and certain other sales of collateral since the date of the most recent amendment, our borrowing base was reduced to $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our borrowing base may be further reduced if we dispose of a certain percentage of the value of collateral securing the facility. The amendment also granted temporary financial covenant relief, with the revolving credit facility’s existing first lien secured leverage ratio and net debt to capitalization ratio suspended until September 30, 2017 and the interest coverage ratio maintenance covenant reduced as noted below. In addition, we agreed to grant liens and security interests on a majority of our assets, as well as maintain a minimum liquidity amount (defined as cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility) of $500 million until the suspension of the existing maintenance covenants ends. The amendment reduced the interest coverage ratio from 1.1 to 1.0 to 0.65 to 1.0 through the first quarter of 2017, after which it will increase to 0.70 to 1.0 for the second quarter of 2017, 1.2 to 1.0 for the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25 to 1.0 thereafter. The amendment also includes a collateral value coverage test whereby if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of March 31, 2017, falls below 1.25 to 1.0, our borrowing ability will be reduced in order to satisfy such ratio. Our collateral value exceeded the 1.25 to 1.0 threshold as of March 31, 2017. The amendment also gives us the ability to incur up to $2.5 billion of first lien indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the existing obligations under the credit agreement, subject to a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall in favor of the revolving lenders and affiliated hedge providers and the other limitations on junior lien debt set forth in the credit agreement. After taking into account the term loan, the amount of additional first lien indebtedness permitted by the revolving credit facility is $1.0 billion. Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our senior notes based on the market value of our publicly traded debt as determined based on the yield of our senior notes (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt is based on a market approach using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (Level 2).

Prior to maturity under certain circumstances and at the holder’s option, the notes are convertible into cash, our common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the second quarter of 2017, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes in the third quarter of 2017 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter. Upon conversion of a convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election, according to the conversion rate specified in the indenture.The common stock price conversion threshold amount for the convertible senior notes is 130% of the conversion price.Optional Redemption by the Company. We may redeem the convertible senior notes for cash on or after September 15, 2019, if the price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price during a specified period at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes.Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes upon certain fundamental changes.(d)The repurchase, conversion, contingent interest and redemption provisions of our contingent convertible senior notes are as follows:Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date and upon certain fundamental changes.Optional Conversion by Holders. At the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, our common stock using a net share settlement process. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period within a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the Current Quarter, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash or common stock in the third quarter of 2017 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Contingent Interest. We will pay contingent interest on the contingent convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years during certain periods if the average trading price of the notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture.The holders’ demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Holders' Demand Repurchase Dates Common Stock Price Conversion Thresholds Contingent InterestFirst Payable(if applicable) 2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2020, 2025, 2030 $45.02 May 14, 2016 2.5% due 2037 May 15, 2022, 2027, 2032 $59.44 November 14, 2017 2.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $100.20 June 14, 2019Optional Redemption by the Company. We may redeem the contingent convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. In July 2017, we redeemed our remaining 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 and our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037.(e)The carrying amounts as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, are reflected net of discounts of $427 million and $461 million, respectively, associated with the equity component of our convertible and contingent convertible senior notes. This amount is being amortized based on the effective yield method through the first demand repurchase date as applicable.(f)See Interest Rate Derivatives in Note 8 for further discussion related to these instruments.(g)As of June 30, 2017, current maturities of long-term debt, net includes our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 and our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037. As discussed in footnote (d) above, we redeemed both series of these notes in July 2017. Term Loan FacilityWe have a secured five-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. Our obligations under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our revolving credit facility, second lien notes and senior notes and are secured by first-priority liens on the same collateral securing our revolving credit facility (with a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall junior to the revolving credit facility). The term loan bears interest at a rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 7.50% per annum, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor, or the Alternative Base Rate (ABR) plus 6.50% per annum, subject to a 2.00% ABR floor, at our option. The term loan matures in August 2021 and voluntary prepayments are subject to a make-whole premium prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the term loan, a premium to par of 4.25% from the second anniversary until but excluding the third anniversary, a premium to par of 2.125% from the third anniversary until but excluding the fourth anniversary and at par beginning on the fourth anniversary. The term loan may be subject to mandatory prepayments and offers to purchase with net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, certain asset sales and other dispositions of collateral and upon a change of control. Senior Secured Second Lien NotesOur second lien notes are secured second lien obligations and are effectively junior to our current and future secured first lien indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred under our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, effectively senior to all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness, including our outstanding senior notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral, and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur. We have the option to redeem the second lien notes, in whole or in part, at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our second lien notes are governed by an indenture containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to create liens securing certain indebtedness, enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions, consolidate, merge or transfer assets and dispose of certain collateral and use proceeds from dispositions of certain collateral. As a holding company, Chesapeake owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the second lien notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. In December 2015, certain of the existing notes that were exchanged for the second lien notes were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). For the exchanges classified as a TDR, if the future undiscounted cash flows of the newly issued debt are less than the net carrying value of the original debt, a gain is recorded for the difference and the carrying value of the newly issued debt is adjusted to the future undiscounted cash flow amount and no future interest expense is recorded. All future interest payments on the newly issued debt reduce the carrying value. Senior Notes, Contingent Convertible Senior Notes and Convertible Senior NotesOur obligations under our outstanding senior notes and convertible senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are minor and, as such, we have not included condensed consolidating financial information in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense through the first demand repurchase date, as applicable, at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. The applicable rates for our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037, our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 and our 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 are 8.0%, 8.0% and 11.5%, respectively.During the Current Quarter, we issued in a private placement $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 8.00% Senior Notes due 2027 at par for net proceeds of approximately $742 million. Some or all of the notes may be redeemed at any time prior to June 15, 2022, subject to a make-whole premium. We also may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after June 15, 2022, at the applicable redemption price in accordance with the terms of the notes and the indenture and supplemental indenture governing the notes. In addition, subject to certain conditions, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at any time prior to June 15, 2020, at a price equal to 108% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed using the net proceeds of certain equity offerings.In the Current Period, we retired $1.604 billion principal amount of our outstanding senior notes, senior secured second lien notes and contingent convertible notes through purchases in the open market, tender offers or repayment upon maturity for $1.746 billion. Included in these retirements is the maturity of our 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017, which were carried at $258 million based on the December 31, 2016 exchange rate of $1.0517 to €1.00 and the corresponding cross currency swap. See Foreign Currency Derivatives in Note 8 for further information. For the open market repurchases and tender offers, we recorded aggregate gains of approximately $191 million and $184 million in the Current Quarter and the Current Period, respectively.In the Prior Period, we retired $558 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes through purchases in the open market or repayment upon maturity for $472 million. Additionally, we privately negotiated an exchange of approximately $577 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes for 109,351,707 common shares. We recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $168 million associated with these repurchases and exchanges, including $68 million in the Prior Quarter.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a senior secured revolving credit facility currently subject to a $3.8 billion borrowing base that matures in December 2019. Our borrowing base may be reduced in certain circumstances, including if we dispose of a certain percentage of the value of collateral securing the revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $575 million under the revolving credit facility and had used $100 million of the revolving credit facility for various letters of credit. The terms of the revolving credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. We were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the agreement as of June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, we were able to borrow the full availability under the revolving credit facility. On June 15, 2017, we completed a scheduled borrowing base redetermination review and our lenders reaffirmed our $3.8 billion borrowing base. Our next scheduled borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for the second quarter of 2018. On May 19, 2017, we entered into the fourth amendment to our revolving credit facility. Among other things, the amendment removed the requirement that we must concurrently prepay, repurchase or redeem or otherwise defease at least an equal amount of other borrowed money indebtedness with a stated maturity prior to December 15, 2019, if we optionally prepay, repurchase or redeem or otherwise defease other borrowed money indebtedness with a stated maturity after December 15, 2019.During 2016, we entered into the third amendment to our revolving credit facility. The amendment reaffirmed our borrowing base and granted temporary financial covenant relief, with the revolving credit facility’s existing first lien secured leverage ratio and net debt to capitalization ratio suspended until September 30, 2017 (at which point the maximum first lien secured leverage ratio will be 3.50 to 1.0 through the period ending December 31, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.0 thereafter and the maximum net debt to capitalization ratio for each period will be 65%) and the interest coverage ratio maintenance covenant reduced as noted below. In addition, we agreed to grant liens and security interests on a majority of our assets, as well as maintain a minimum liquidity amount (defined as cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility) of $500 million until the suspension of the existing maintenance covenants ends. The third amendment reduced the interest coverage ratio to 0.70 to 1.0 for the second quarter of 2017, after which it will increase to 1.2 to 1.0 for the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25 to 1.0 thereafter. The amendment also gives us the ability to incur up to $2.5 billion of first lien indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the existing obligations under the credit agreement, subject to a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall in favor of the revolving lenders and affiliated hedge providers and the other limitations on junior lien debt set forth in the credit agreement. After taking into account the term loan, the amount of additional first lien indebtedness permitted by the revolving credit facility is $1.0 billion. Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our senior notes based on the market value of our publicly traded debt as determined based on the yield of our senior notes (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt is based on a market approach using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (Level 2). Fair value is compared to the carrying value, excluding the impact of interest rate derivatives, in the table below.

Prior to maturity under certain circumstances and at the holder’s option, the notes are convertible into cash, our common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the Current Quarter, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes in the fourth quarter of 2017 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter. Upon conversion of a convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election, according to the conversion rate specified in the indenture.The common stock price conversion threshold amount for the convertible senior notes is 130% of the conversion price of $8.568.Optional Redemption by the Company. We may redeem the convertible senior notes for cash on or after September 15, 2019, if the price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price during a specified period at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes.Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes upon certain fundamental changes.(d)The carrying amounts as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, are reflected net of discounts of $420 million and $461 million, respectively, associated with the equity component of our convertible and contingent convertible senior notes.

Some or all of the notes may be redeemed at any time prior to June 15, 2022, subject to a make-whole premium. We also may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after June 15, 2022, at the applicable redemption price in accordance with the terms of the notes and the indenture and supplemental indenture governing the notes.

For the open market repurchases and tender offers, we recorded an aggregate loss of approximately $1 million in the Current Quarter and an aggregate gain of approximately $183 million in the Current Period including $260 million of premium associated with our 8.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022.In the Prior Period, we retired $2.192 billion principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes through purchases in the open market, tender offers or repayment upon maturity for $1.5 billion. Additionally, we privately negotiated an exchange of approximately $577 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes for 109,351,707 common shares. We recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $255 million associated with these repurchases and exchanges.Term Loan FacilityWe have a secured five-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2017. Our obligations under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our revolving credit facility, second lien notes and senior notes and are secured by first-priority liens on the same collateral securing our revolving credit facility (with a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall junior to the revolving credit facility). The term loan bears interest at a rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 7.50% per annum, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor, or the Alternative Base Rate (ABR) plus 6.50% per annum, subject to a 2.00% ABR floor, at our option. The term loan matures in August 2021 and voluntary prepayments are subject to a make-whole premium prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the term loan, a premium to par of 4.25% from the second anniversary until but excluding the third anniversary, a premium to par of 2.125% from the third anniversary until but excluding the fourth anniversary and at par beginning on the fourth anniversary. The term loan may be subject to mandatory prepayments and offers to purchase with net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, certain asset sales and other dispositions of collateral and upon a change of control.Senior Secured Second Lien NotesOur second lien notes are secured second lien obligations and are effectively junior to our current and future secured first lien indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred under our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, effectively senior to all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness, including our outstanding senior notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral, and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur. We have the option to redeem the second lien notes, in whole or in part, at specified make-whole or redemption prices. Our second lien notes are governed by an indenture containing covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to create liens securing certain indebtedness, enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions, consolidate, merge or transfer assets and dispose of certain collateral and use proceeds from dispositions of certain collateral. As a holding company, Chesapeake owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Chesapeake’s obligations under the second lien notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. In December 2015, certain of the existing notes that were exchanged for the second lien notes were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). For the exchanges classified as a TDR, if the future undiscounted cash flows of the newly issued debt are less than the net carrying value of the original debt, a gain is recorded for the difference and the carrying value of the newly issued debt is adjusted to the future undiscounted cash flow amount and no future interest expense is recorded. All future interest payments on the newly issued debt reduce the carrying value. Senior Notes, Contingent Convertible Senior Notes and Convertible Senior NotesOur obligations under our outstanding senior notes and convertible senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are minor and, as such, we have not included condensed consolidating financial information in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.We are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately and to reflect interest expense through the first demand repurchase date, as applicable, at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt at the time of issuance. The applicable rates for our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 and our 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 are 8.0% and 11.5%, respectively.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a senior secured revolving credit facility currently subject to a $3.8 billion borrowing base that matures in December 2019. Our borrowing base may be reduced in certain circumstances, including if we dispose of a certain percentage of the value of collateral securing the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $645 million under the revolving credit facility and had used $97 million of the revolving credit facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate. The terms of the revolving credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the agreement and we were able to borrow the full availability under the revolving credit facility. As discussed in Note 16, on October 30, 2017, we completed a scheduled borrowing base redetermination review and our lenders reaffirmed our $3.8 billion borrowing base. Our next scheduled borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for the second quarter of 2018.During 2016, we entered into the third amendment to our revolving credit facility. The amendment granted temporary financial covenant relief, with the revolving credit facility’s existing first lien secured leverage ratio and net debt to capitalization ratio suspended until September 30, 2017 (at which point the maximum first lien secured leverage ratio became 3.50 to 1.0 through the period ending December 31, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.0 thereafter and the maximum net debt to capitalization ratio for each period will be 65%) and the interest coverage ratio maintenance covenant reduced as noted below. In addition, we agreed to grant liens and security interests on a majority of our assets, as well as maintain a minimum liquidity amount (defined as cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility) of $500 million until the suspension of the existing maintenance covenants ends. The third amendment increased the interest coverage ratio to 1.2 to 1.0 for the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25 to 1.0 thereafter. The amendment also gives us the ability to incur up to $2.5 billion of first lien indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the existing obligations under the credit agreement, subject to a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall in favor of the revolving lenders and affiliated hedge providers and the other limitations on junior lien debt set forth in the credit agreement. After taking into account the term loan repurchases discussed in Note 16, the amount of additional first lien indebtedness permitted by the revolving credit facility is $1.2 billion. Fair Value of DebtWe estimate the fair value of our senior notes based on the market value of our publicly traded debt as determined based on the yield of our senior notes (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt is based on a market approach using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (Level 2).

      "s were used, in addition to borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, to pay down the Company's term loan facility. Covenants The revolving credit facility is subject to covenants including the maintenance of specific financial ratios. The financial ratio covenants consist of a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 as of the measurement date and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 3.75 to 1.0 on the measurement date. The consolidated interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) by Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the credit agreement), both as measured on a trailing 12 month basis preceding the measurement date. As of June 30, 2010, the Company's consolidated interest coverage ratio was 6.9 times. Consolidated Interest Expense excludes, among other things, interest expense on any Securitization Indebtedness (as defined in the credit agreement). The consolidated leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Consolidated Total Indebtedness (as defined in the credit agreement and which excludes, among other things, Securitization Indebtedness) as of the measurement date by Consolidated EBITDA as measured on a trailing 12 month basis preceding the measurement date. As of June 30, 2010, the Company's consolidated leverage ratio was 1.8 times. Covenants in this credit facility also include limitations on indebtedness of material subsidiaries; liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sale of all or substantially all assets; and sale and leaseback transactions. Events of default in this credit facility include failure to pay interest, principal and fees when due; breach of a covenant or warranty; acceleration of or failure to pay other debt in excess of $50 million (excluding Securitization Indebtedness); insolvency matters; and a change of control. The 6.00% senior unsecured notes, 9.875% senior unsecured notes and 7.375% senior unsecured notes contain various covenants including limitations on liens, limitations on potential sale and leaseback transactions and change of control restrictions. In addition, there are limitations on mergers, consolidations and potential sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets. Events of default in the notes include failure to pay interest and principal when due, breach of a covenant or warranty, acceleration of other debt in excess of $50 million and insolvency matters. The Convertible Notes do not contain affirmative or negative covenants; however, the limitations on mergers, consolidations and potential sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the events of defaul\n",
      "t for the Company's senior unsecured notes are applicable to such notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Convertible Notes at 100% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a fundamental change, defined to include, among other things, a change of control, certain recapitalizations and if the Company's common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange. As of June 30, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants described above. Each of the Company's non-recourse, securitized term notes and the bank conduit facility contain various triggers relating to the performance of the applicable loan pools. For example, if the vacation ownership contract receivables pool that collateralizes one of the Company's securitization notes fails to perform within the parameters established by the contractual triggers (such as higher default or delinquency rates), there are provisions pursuant to which the cash flows for that pool will be maintained in the securitization as extra collateral for the note holders or applied to accelerate the repayment of outstanding principal to the noteholders. As of June 30, 2010, all of the Company's securitized loan pools were in compliance with applicable contractual triggers.

Vacation Ownership Contract Receivables and Securitizations The Company pools qualifying vacation ownership contract receivables and sells them to bankruptcy-remote entities. Vacation ownership contract receivables qualify for securitization based primarily on the credit strength of the VOI purchaser to whom financing has been extended. Vacation ownership contract receivables are securitized through bankruptcy-remote SPEs that are consolidated within the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, the Company does not recognize gains or losses resulting from these securitizations at the time of sale to the SPEs. Income is recognized when earned over the contractual life of the vacation ownership contract receivables. The Company services the securitized vacation ownership contract receivables pursuant to servicing agreements negotiated on an arms-length basis based on market conditions. The activities of these SPEs are limited to (i) purchasing vacation ownership contract receivables from the Company's vacation ownership subsidiaries; (ii) issuing debt securities and/or borrowing under a conduit facility to fund such purchases; and (iii) entering into derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure. The assets of these bankruptcy-remote SPEs are not available to pay the Company's general obligations. Additionally, the creditors of these SPEs have no recourse to the Company for principal and interest. The assets and liabilities of these vacation ownership SPEs are as follows: June 30, December 31, 2010 2009 Securitized contract receivables, gross (a) $ 2,684 $ 2,591 Securitized restricted cash (b) 153 133 Interest receivables on securitized contract receivables (c) 21 20 Other assets (d) 4 11 Total SPE assets (e) 2,862 2,755 Securitized term notes (f) 1,255 1,112 Securitized conduit facilities (f) 291 395 Other liabilities (g) 26 26 Total SPE liabilities 1,572 1,533 SPE assets in excess of SPE liabilities $ 1,290 $ 1,222 ­ ­ (a) Included in current ($259 million and $244 million as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively) and non-current ($2,425 million and $2,347 million as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively) vacation ownership contract receivables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition, the Company has vacation ownership contract receivables that have not been securitized through bankruptcy-remote SPEs. Such gross receivables were $659 million and $860 million as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. A summary of such receivables and total vacation ownership SPE assets in excess of SPE liabilities and net of the allowance for loan losses, is as follows: June 30, December 31, 2010 2009 SPE assets in excess of SPE liabilities $ 1,290 $ 1,222 Non-securitized contract receivables 659 598 Secured contract receivables (*) — 262 Allowance for loan losses (358 ) (370 ) Total, net $ 1,591 $ 1,712 ­ ­ (*) As of December 31, 2009, such receivables collateralized the Company's secured, revolving foreign credit facility, which was paid down and terminated during March 2010.

Maturities and Capacity The Company's outstanding debt as of September 30, 2010 matures as follows: Securitized Vacation Ownership Debt Other Total Within 1 year $ 187 $ 32 $ 219 Between 1 and 2 years 249 311 (*) 560 Between 2 and 3 years 318 11 329 Between 3 and 4 years 189 277 466 Between 4 and 5 years 162 12 174 Thereafter 510 1,358 1,868 $ 1,615 $ 2,001 $ 3,616 ­ ­ (*) Includes a liability of $168 million related to the Bifurcated Conversion Feature associated with the Company's Convertible Notes. As maturities of the securitized vacation ownership debt are based on the contractual payment terms of the underlying vacation ownership contract receivables, actual maturities may differ as a result of prepayments by the vacation ownership contract receivable obligors. As of September 30, 2010, available capacity under the Company's borrowing arrangements was as follows: Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings Available Capacity Securitized vacation ownership debt: Term notes $ 1,400 $ 1,400 $ — Bank conduit facility (a) 600 215 385 Total securitized vacation ownership debt (b) $ 2,000 $ 1,615 $ 385 Long-term debt: 6.00% senior unsecured notes (due December 2016) $ 798 $ 798 $ — Revolving credit facility (due October 2013) (c) 950 26 924 9.875% senior unsecured notes (due May 2014) 240 240 — 3.50% convertible notes (due May 2012) 289 289 — 7.375% senior unsecured notes (due March 2020) 247 247 — 5.75% senior unsecured notes (due February 2018) 247 247 — Vacation rentals capital leases 120 120 — Other 56 34 22 Total long-term debt $ 2,947 $ 2,001 946 Less: Issuance of letters of credit (c) 28 $ 918 ­ ­ (a) The capacity of this facility is subject to the Company's ability to provide additional assets to collateralize additional securitized borrowings.

As of September 30, 2010, the available capacity of $924 million was further reduced by $28 million for the issuance of letters of credit. Vacation Ownership Contract Receivables and Securitizations The Company pools qualifying vacation ownership contract receivables and sells them to bankruptcy-remote entities. Vacation ownership contract receivables qualify for securitization based primarily on the credit strength of the VOI purchaser to whom financing has been extended. Vacation ownership contract receivables are securitized through bankruptcy-remote SPEs that are consolidated within the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, the Company does not recognize gains or losses resulting from these securitizations at the time of sale to the SPEs. Income is recognized when earned over the contractual life of the vacation ownership contract receivables. The Company services the securitized vacation ownership contract receivables pursuant to servicing agreements negotiated on an arms-leng\n",
      "th basis based on market conditions. The activities of these SPEs are limited to (i) purchasing vacation ownership contract receivables from the Company's vacation ownership subsidiaries; (ii) issuing debt securities and/or borrowing under a conduit facility to fund such purchases; and (iii) entering into derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure. The bankruptcy-remote SPEs are legally separate from the Company. The receivables held by the bankruptcy-remote SPEs are not available to creditors of the Company and legally are not assets of the Company. The assets and liabilities of these vacation ownership SPEs are as follows: September 30, December 31, 2010 2009 Securitized contract receivables, gross (a) $ 2,709 $ 2,591 Securitized restricted cash (b) 140 133 Interest receivables on securitized contract receivables (c) 22 20 Other assets (d) 3 11 Total SPE assets (e) 2,874 2,755 Securitized term notes (f) 1,400 1,112 Securitized conduit facilities (f) 215 395 Other liabilities (g) 25 26 Total SPE liabilities 1,640 1,533 SPE assets in excess of SPE liabilities $ 1,234 $ 1,222 ­ ­ (a) Included in current ($251 million and $244 million as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively) and non-current ($2,458 million and $2,347 million as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively) vacation ownership contract receivables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(g) Primarily includes interest rate derivative contracts and accrued interest on securitized debt; included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities ($4 million as of both September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009) and other non-current liabilities ($21 million and $22 million as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively) on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company has vacation ownership contract receivables that have not been securitized through bankruptcy-remote SPEs. Such gross receivables were $667 million and $860 million as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. A summary of such receivables and total vacation ownership SPE assets in excess of SPE liabilities and net of the allowance for loan losses, is as follows: September 30, December 31, 2010 2009 SPE assets in excess of SPE liabilities $ 1,234 $ 1,222 Non-securitized contract receivables 667 598 Secured contract receivables (*) — 262 Allowance for loan losses (364 ) (370 ) Total, net $ 1,537 $ 1,712 ­ ­ (*) As of December 31, 2009, such receivables collateralized the Company's secured, revolving foreign credit facility, which was paid down and terminated during March 2010.

Additionally, in connection with the early extinguishment of the term loan facility during the first quarter of 2010, the Company effectively terminated a relat\n",
      "ed interest rate swap agreement, which resulted in the reclassification of a $14 million unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The Company also recorded an additional $2 million of costs during the first quarter of 2010 in connection with the early extinguishment of its term loan and revolving foreign credit facilities, which was also included within interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Cash paid related to such interest expense was $80 million and $51 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Such amounts exclude cash payments related to early extinguishment of debt costs. Interest expense is partially offset on the Consolidated Statements of Income by capitalized interest of $2 million and $4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively, and $3 million and $8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively.

Interest began accruing on March 1, 2011 and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2011. The notes will mature on March 1, 2021 and are redeemable at the Company's option at any time, in whole or in part, at the stated redemption prices plus accrued interest through the redemption date. These notes rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other senior unsecured indebtedness. Sierra Timeshare 2011-1 Receivables Funding, LLC. On March 25, 2011, the Company closed a series of term notes payable, Sierra Timeshare 2011-1 Receivables Funding LLC, in the initial principal amount of $400 million at an advance rate of 98%. These borrowings bear interest at a weighted average coupon rate of 3.70% and are secured by vacation ownership contract receivables. As of March 31, 2011, the Company had $400 million of outstanding borrowings under these term notes. 3.50% Convertible Notes During May 2009, the Company issued convertible notes (\"Convertible Notes\") with face value of $230 million and bearing interest at a rate of 3.50%. Concurrent with such issuance, the Company purchased cash-settled call options (\"Call Options\") and entered into warrant transactions (\"Warrants\"). The agreements for such transactions contain anti-dilution provisions that require certain adjustments to be made as a result of all quarterly cash dividend increases above $0.04 per share that occur prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, Call Options and Warrants. During March 2010, the Company increased its quarterly dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.12 per share and, subsequently, during March 2011, from $0.12 per share to $0.15 per share. As a result of the dividend increase and required adjustments, as of March 31, 2011, the Convertible Notes had a conversion reference rate of 79.8541 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to a conversion price of $12.52 per share of the Company's common stock), the conversion price of the Call Options was $12.52 and the exercise price of the Warrants was $19.83. During the third and fourth quarters of 2010, the Company repurchased a portion of its Convertible Notes in the open market, with a carrying value of $239 million ($101 million for the portion of Convertible Notes, including the unamortized discount, and $138 million for the related Bifurcated Conversion Feature). Concurrent with the repurchase, the Company settled a related portion of the Call Options and Warrants. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased a portion of its remaining Convertible Notes with carrying value of $238 million primarily resulting from the completion of a cash tender offer ($90 million for the portion of Convertible Notes, including the unamortized discount, and $148 million for the related Bifurcated Conversion Feature) for $249 million, which resulted in a loss of $11 million. Concurrent with the repurchases, the Company settled (i) a portion of the Call Options for proceeds of $147 million, which resulted in an additional loss of $1 million, and (ii) a portion of the Warrants with payments of $106 million. As a result of these transactions, the Company made net payments of $208 million and incurred total losses of $12 million during the first quarter of 2011 and reduced the number of shares related to the Warrants to approximately 1 million as of March 31, 2011. Early Extinguishment of Debt During the first quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased a portion of its Convertible Notes and settled a portion of the related Call Options. In connection with these transactions, the Company incurred a loss of $12 million during the first quarter of 2011, which is included within interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. During the first quarter of 2010, in connection with the early extinguishment of the term loan facility, the Company effectively terminated a related interest rate swap agreement. This resulted in a reclassification of a $14 million unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") to interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company incurred an additional $2 million of costs in connection with the early extinguishment of its term loan and revolving foreign credit facilities, which is also included within interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Covenants The revolving credit facility is subject to covenants including the maintenance of specific financial ratios. The financial ratio covenants consist of a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 as of the measurement date and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 3.75 to 1.0 as of the measurement date. The consolidated interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) by consolidated interest expense (as defined in the credit agreement), both as measured on a trailing 12 month basis preceding the measurement date. Consolidated interest expense excludes, among other things, interest expense on any securitization indebtedness (as defined in the credit agreement). The consolidated leverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated total indebtedness (as defined in the credit agreement and which excludes, among other things, securitization indebtedness) as of the measurement date by consolidated EBITDA as measured on a trailing 12 month basis preceding the measurement date. Covenants in this credit facility also include limitations on indebtedness of material subsidiaries; liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sale of all or substantially all assets; and sale and leaseback transactions. Events of default in this credit facility include failure to pay interest, principal and fees when due; breach of a covenant or warranty; acceleration of or failure to pay other debt in excess of $50 million (excluding securitization indebtedness); insolvency matters; and a change of control. The 6.00% senior unsecured notes, 9.875% senior unsecured notes, 7.375% senior unsecured notes, 5.75% senior unsecured notes and 5.625% senior unsecured notes contain various covenants including limitations on liens, limitations on potential sale and leaseback transactions and change of control restrictions. In addition, there are limitations on mergers, consolidations and potential sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets. Events of default in the notes include failure to pay interest and principal when due, breach of a covenant or warranty, acceleration of other debt in excess of $50 million and insolvency matters. The Convertible Notes do not contain affirmative or negative covenants; however, the limitations on mergers, consolidations and potential sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the events of default for the Company's senior unsecured notes are applicable to such notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Convertible Notes at 100% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a fundamental change, defined to include, among other things, a change of control, certain recapitalizations and if the Company's common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange. As of March 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants described above. Each of the Company's non-recourse, securitized term notes and the bank conduit facility contain various triggers relating to the performance of the applicable loan pools. If the vacation ownership contract receivables pool that collateralizes one of the Company's securitization notes fails to perform within the parameters established by the contractual triggers (such as higher default or delinquency rates), there are provisions pursuant to which the cash flows for that pool will be maintained in the securitization as extra collateral for the note holders or applied to accelerate the repayment of outstanding principal to the noteholders. As of March 31, 2011, all of the Company's securitized loan pools were in compliance with applicable contractual triggers. Maturities and Capacity The Company's outstanding debt as of March 31, 2011 matures as follows: Securitized Vacation Ownership Debt Other Total Within 1 year $ 216 $ 12 $ 228 Between 1 and 2 years 312 78 (*) 390 Between 2 and 3 years 209 16 225 Between 3 and 4 years 201 253 454 Between 4 and 5 years 190 12 202 Thereafter 686 1,600 2,286 $ 1,814 $ 1,971 $ 3,785 ­ ­ (*) Includes a liability of $25 million related to the Bifurcated Conversion Feature associated with the Company's Convertible Notes.

Each of our non-recourse term securitizations and bank conduit facilities contain certain tests based on default, delinquency and overcollateralization rates of the loan pool that collateralizes such non-recourse financing. If a loan pool is not in compliance with those tests, the cash flows form that loan pool will be retained as extra collateral for such financing or applied to accelerate the repayment of outstanding principal to the note holders.

Commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, the financial ratio covenants consist of a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 2.5 to 1.0 as of the measurement date and a maximum first lien leverage ratio not to exceed 4.25 to 1.0 as of the measurement date. The interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) by consolidated interest expense (as defined in the credit agreement), both as measured on a trailing 12-month basis preceding the measurement date. As of September 30, 2018, our interest coverage ratio was 6.1 to 1.0. The first lien leverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated first lien debt (as defined in the credit agreement) as of the measurement date by consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) as measured on a trailing 12-month basis preceding the measurement date. As of September 30, 2018, our first lien leverage ratio was 2.9 to 1.0. These ratios do not include interest expense or indebtedness related to any qualified securitization financing (as defined in the credit agreement). As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants described above. Each of our non-recourse term securitizations and bank conduit facilities contain certain tests based on default, delinquency and overcollateralization rates of the loan pool that collateralizes such non-recourse financing. If a loan pool is not in compliance with those tests, the cash flows for that loan pool will be retained as extra collateral for such financing or applied to accelerate the repayment of outstanding principal to the note holders. As of September 30, 2018, all of our loan pools were in compliance with the applicable tests.
